<a id="_idIndexMarker658"></a><span class="Drop-Cap">A</span><span class="Opening-Drop-Words">t the end of 1 Timothy</span>, Timothy is exhorted to “guard what has been entrusted to you,” or perhaps, “guard what has been deposited with you.” <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is exhortation calls to mind the image of one person depositing a large sum of money or some other valuable item with another for safekeeping. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e scriptural writers and the Christian writers who followed them saw the Christian truths and way of life as a great treasure, one that had been entrusted to their care and that was to be handed over intact to the next generation. As was remarked earlier (see Chapter Seven), the modern mind tends to view “tradition” very differently—as something left over, unexamined, something which probably needs to be updated or discarded. It is “just tradition.” By contrast, the first Christians viewed tradition as the careful handing on of their greatest treasure—the life in Christ and the teachings which made that life possible. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey could not be truly faithful to Christ unless they could hand on well what had been handed on to them. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey could not really be faithful to Christ unless they could maintain and uphold that with which they had been charged (see <a id="_idIndexMarker659"></a><span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Tm 1:18; <a id="_idIndexMarker660"></a>6:14; <a id="_idIndexMarker661"></a><span class="Lining-Nums">2 </span>Tm 2:2; <a id="_idIndexMarker662"></a>4:1<span class="No-Break">–5</span>).

<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere was a time in Christian history when people would have been directed to Christian tradition, especially to the Fathers, if they wanted to test their own reading of scripture. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ose who had authority in the area of scriptural interpretation were those who stood in the succession of Christian teachers, men who were dedicated to faithfully passing on what they had received, who were known to be committed Christians and holy men, and who sometimes gave their lives for what they believed. It was with their writings that Christians compared their own thoughts. For all the differences in their reading of tradition, this was true for Protestants as well as for Catholics and Orthodox, at least for men such as Luther, Calvin, and Wesley. In more recent years, however, there has been a shift. People are now supposed to compare their interpretation of scripture with that of scripture scholars, Christian or pagan, preferably those who are the most recent. Underlying this change in scriptural interpretive authority is a further change in the understanding of scriptural interpretation: a change in the Christian mind that is one of the more significant changes among the Christian people in recent centuries.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e last chapters presented the scriptural teaching on the roles of men and women; they included a discussion of the ideas and insights of modern scripture scholars. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is chapter and the next will compare the views of the early teachers in Christian tradition (the Fathers) with the results of the previous chapters. While the understandings of the Fathers of the Christian church have been present in the earlier chapters, as the footnotes and occasional references in the text reveal, these two chapters will consider them and the rest of Christian tradition explicitly. For a subject like that of the roles of men and women, Christian tradition can more easily be treated in a brief form, since the primary contribution it makes is to underline and strengthen the results of the scripture discussion. Christian tradition does have more to say about the roles of men and women than appears explicitly in scripture, but it does not diverge from or add significantly to the main outlines of the roles for men and women as set forth in scripture.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Many have remarked that one of the main advantages of reading Christian tradition is the protection it gives modern Christians from the limitations of their own age when they come to read scripture or think about Christianity. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e subject of the roles of men and women is one of the areas where tradition can best perform such a service. As was pointed out in the last chapter, our age is quick to judge that cultural conditioning relativizes the contributions of the past, but it does not at the same time eagerly apply this same approach to the dogmas of the present. By contrast, Christian tradition consistently sees the distinctiveness of the scriptural approach to the roles of men and women and carries on that scriptural teaching from age to age and from culture to culture. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e steady witness of tradition can help us see more clearly how the views of the present age color a reading of the scriptural message about the roles of men and women.

<p class="BODY-STYLES_Subhead-Opening">
<a id="_idIndexMarker664"></a><span class="Regular">“Tradition” </span>(<span class="Italic">paradosis</span>), as was discussed in Chapter Seven, means “handing over,” “handing on,” or, more literally, “giving over.” In this and the following chapter, the word refers to the handing on of what was taught by Jesus and the apostles. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere is tradition in scripture. Scripture sees the basic gospel message itself as a matter of tradition (<span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Cor 15:1<span class="No-Break">–5</span>; <span class="Lining-Nums">2 </span><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span> 2<span class="No-Break">–5</span>; see also Col 2:6<span class="No-Break">–8</span>; <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span> 2:13). It also sees basic teaching about the Christian way of life, including Christian social customs, as a matter of tradition (<span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Cor 11:2, 23; <span class="Lining-Nums">2 </span><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span> 3:6; Rom 6:17; Phil 4:9). In a real sense, all of the New Testament could be said to be tradition. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e books of the New Testament were carefully handed on with their authority attested to by those who handed them on.<a id="_idTextAnchor498"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1513">2</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Tradition continued from the scripture to the early church. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e teaching of Jesus and his apostles was handed on from teacher to teacher.<a id="_idTextAnchor499"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1514">3</a></span> Later ages termed the great teachers of the earliest tradition “Fathers” of the church. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese men were pastors, most commonly bishops but also presbyters or elders, both officially ordained and unordained. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey were men with a recognized teaching gift and of recognized holiness of life and tested doctrine. Because of the kind of men they were and the kind of teaching they did, the Fathers were seen as men who taught with great authority and therefore men whose opinions carried weight. Not all of them were of equal authority, however. Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus, Athanasius, Basil, Ambrose, John Chrysostom, and Augustine were clearly recognized as greater authorities than Athenagoras, Methodius, Lactantius, and Didymus. Nonetheless, all the Fathers were seen as witnesses to true Christian tradition.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Sometimes when people refer to Christian tradition, they are primarily referring to the Fathers and referring only in a secondary way, if at all, to later Christian tradition. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere is, however, a broader meaning of “Christian tradition” than the scriptural sense of the handing on of teaching. What was handed on in tradition, in and through the kerygma and teaching, was the presence and life of the Lord Jesus and the active working of the Holy Spirit. Christians handed on a living relationship with Christ. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>us, in a sense, tradition refers to all of Christian history—the history of the Christian people being led by the Spirit through many circumstances and teaching his word in the face of many challenges and new situations.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere are many views of how to approach the writings from Christian tradition. Orthodox, Catholics, and some Protestants acknowledge a reliable and authoritative Christian tradition. Most Protestants find much of Christian tradition helpful, even if they do not hold it as being authoritative. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere is, however, a convergence on some of the most central aspects of viewing tradition. First, Orthodox, Catholics and Protestants agree that no writing from tradition equals scripture in authority.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-107-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-107">*</a></span></span> In the view of some, tradition might be of highest authority because they see it as a passing on of the revelation given through the apostles, but no individual writing outside the canonized scripture is equal in authority to scripture.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-106-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-106">†</a></span></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Second, no orthodox Christian views tradition as a substitute for scripture. Rather, the writings of tradition are seen as an aid in understanding scripture. Even among Catholic theologians who hold that some of Christian revelation was preserved in tradition but is not contained in scripture,<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-105-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-105">‡</a></span></span> there is clear agreement that the primary purpose of tradition is to aid in the interpretation of scripture.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Finally, for Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant alike, not everything found in Christian history or written by one of the Fathers is true tradition in the sense of having been authentically handed over by Jesus or the apostles. First, in addition to the handing on of the basic Christian proclamation and teaching, there is what could be called good Christian human tradition. Good Christians in the past, like good Christians now, have had to deal with new circumstances. As a result, they have had new insights and wisdom, and have learned from the writings and experiences of others, including non-Christians. Much of this has been done with the help, discernment, and even inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Second, there is also mistake and corruption in Christian tradition in the broad sense, and failure to faithfully pass on Christian tradition in the narrower sense. Even the greatest of the Fathers made mistakes and omissions, and their teaching is not on the same level of authority as the scriptures. Hence, Christian writings through the centuries, the patristic writings among them, have to be sorted out and tested to find the reliable elements and also to find what in it is true tradition in the full sense of teaching faithfully handed on from Christ and the apostles. Because of the nature of the tradition on the roles of men and women, especially because of the uniform consensus on matters of social role until most recent centuries, the theological differences among Christian groups on assessing tradition do not affect the results of the study. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese chapters can easily operate within the field defined by the convergence of the major Christian theological positions.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese chapters will provide a brief survey of the sources from earlier centuries about the roles of men and women among the Christian people and then consider the further history of that tradition.<a id="_idTextAnchor502"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1515">4</a></span> Each chapter will take one area in the scriptural teaching on basic social structure and trace it through the Fathers. Chapter Twelve will treat the husband-wife relationship in the family, partly because of its intrinsic importance, and partly because it presents one of the clearest examples of a unanimous confirmation of scripture by tradition. Chapter <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>irteen will treat the rule that the governing authorities of the Christian community should be chosen from among the men of the community. In the course of these two chapters, other aspects of the teaching of tradition on the roles of men and women will be considered, but the focus will be upon the two areas just described.

<span class="MaWiC_Subhead-Drop-Words"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e</span> New Testament presents a clear and consistent teaching on the husband-wife relationship. It can be summarized as a relationship of mutual partnership in which the wife is subordinate to the husband for the sake of greater unity. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e husband, as the chief governing authority or head of the family, has a responsibility to care for his wife, while she has a responsibility to be subordinate to him. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is role difference is based on a difference in their areas of responsibility: <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e wife’s primary responsibility is internal to the family, while the husband’s is oriented more to the broader life of the people, both the Christian people and secular society. All of this teaching about the relationship of husband and wife is set within the context of how two Christians, in this case husband and wife, should love one another as brother and sister in the Lord.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is basic New Testament teaching has been held with a clear consistency throughout most of Christian history. Today, many Christians no longer accept the headship of the husband in the family, or even the idea of any role difference at all. But in early tradition the New Testament teaching was carried out in a way that indicated a unanimous consensus about the area. One can read exhortations to husbands showing that the husband was often not performing as the head of the family the way he was supposed to be in theory. However, one cannot find even a small controversy in early tradition over who should be the head of the family, much less over whether there should be a head. Few areas in early Christian teaching are as uniform, and fewer still were held with the same consistency as long as this one, since the first Christian voices advocating a different approach were raised only in about the nineteenth century. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e following series of quotations illustrates how consistent the teaching on the husband-wife relationship was among the early Christian teachers.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-104-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-104">*</a></span></span>

<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI-SA">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e first witnesses to tradition after the New Testament are the Apostolic Fathers, orthodox teachers who lived at a time close enough to the apostles to have been taught by them personally. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Apostolic Fathers show a great deal of similarity to the epistle writers of the New Testament in the way they teach about the roles of men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e “household code” tradition lives on in their writings, and though household life by no means takes up the bulk of their writing, their general exhortations on Christian living often pass on a relationship teaching similar to that in the New Testament. Some examples of such teaching are found in the letter of <a id="_idIndexMarker669"></a>Clement of Rome to the Corinthians (ca. 95 <span class="OT-All-Small-Caps">AD</span>). In commending the Corinthians for the good order they had shown in the past, he says:

<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e wives you enjoined to discharge all their duties with a conscience pure and undefiled and to cherish a dutiful affection for their husbands; you taught them also to stay within the established norm of obedience in managing the household with decency and consummate prudence.

Later in his letter Clement gives the following exhortation in urging the Corinthians to good order:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
Let us guide our wives [<span class="Italic">or</span> women] to what is good. [<span class="Italic">Or:</span> Let us train our wives in all that is good.] Let them exhibit the loveable quality of purity, let them display their sincere gentleness of disposition, let them show the forbearance of their tongues by their silence, let them bestow their affection not with partiality, but in holiness upon all alike who fear God.

We do not say that woman’s nature is the same as man’s, as she is woman. For undoubtedly it stands to reason that some difference should exist between each of them in virtue of which one is male and the other is female. Pregnancy and childbirth, accordingly, we say belong to woman, as she is woman and not as she is a human being. But if there were no difference between man and woman, both would do and suffer the same things. . . . As then there is sameness, as far as respects the soul, she will attain to the same virtue; but as there is difference as respects the peculiar construction of the body, she is destined for childbearing and housekeeping.

Moreover, women must with their own hands, bring from the pantry whatever we need.

If a woman gets out of bed in order to bring her husband something to drink when thirsty, or to bring him something to eat, such an act can only be an exercise beneficial to both her physical and moral health; our Teacher approves of such a woman, who puts her shoulder to the wheel and holds her spindle firmly . . . she also knows how to open her hand to the poor and stretch out her arms to the beggar; she is not ashamed to emulate Sarah in the most beautiful of services: to be helpful to travelers. Abraham, indeed says to her, “knead three measures of wheat flour and make loaves cooked in the ashes.” “Rachel, daughter of Laban,” says Scripture, “arrived with her father’s ewe lambs.” But this is not all: In order to teach us humility, the text adds, “She herself led her father’s sheep to pasture.” (<span class="Italic">Pedagogue</span> 3.10)<a id="_idTextAnchor512"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1523">12</a></span>

Nonetheless, Clement also took role differences seriously. Woman was to be subordinate to man, especially in the family, as her husband’s helper. Her sphere was the home, and there she was essential to her husband both for childbearing and for the management of the household. Origen’s view is basically the same.

Augustine is a controversial teacher in this area because of his views on sex and because of the various later discussions about the effect of those views on Western Christian teaching. However, his view of family life is not particularly controversial, at least not in a way that differs significantly from the other Fathers, and it adds little new to the picture that has emerged so far. More than most of the Fathers, Augustine stresses the idea that woman was given to man as a helper for reproduction. But he does not hold that woman therefore has no purpose outside of marriage, since he believed that consecrated virginity provides a better opportunity for her. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e most important feature of her life comes from what she is as a human being and a Christian. As a woman, however, she was created for childbearing, and her sphere of operation is within the family. She is to be subordinate to her husband, and he is to rule over her and care for her. Each has his or her own sphere of responsibility and his or her own tasks.

<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e teaching of the Fathers of the early church on family life is remarkably uniform.

Some of the Fathers are significantly clearer on the different spheres of responsibility that underlie the role differences, but those different spheres are also visible in scripture. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Fathers show us that the early Christians had a particular way of life which was especially visible in their family life. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey were not like their pagan neighbors, and they did not expect to be.

In some ways patristic teaching is not particularly interesting when it discusses family life. It is more interesting when the Fathers attempt to state the differences between men and women and attempt to provide an understanding of the significance of those differences. It is also more interesting when the Fathers attempt to state the meaning of sex in the Christian life. But the patristic teaching on the roles of men and women in family life does not contain the same variety or tendency to further develop what is contained in scripture. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e reason for this is not difficult to find. Many of the Fathers were educated men who thought seriously about the reasons for the Christian approach to various areas, and they felt a need to defend Christianity against its critics. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey therefore developed “theologies” of men-women differences and of sex. However, in their instructions on family life and the roles of men and women, the Fathers saw themselves more as pastors who were simply passing on a tradition received from the scriptures. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is tradition was not controversial among Christians, even when it differed significantly from the approach of their pagan neighbors. Nor did it differ among Christians from country to country or culture to culture.

<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Next">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is submission, however, does not deny or take away the liberty which fully belongs to the woman both in view of her dignity as a human person, and in view of her most noble office as wife and mother and companion; nor does it bid her obey her husband’s every request if not in harmony with right reason or with the dignity due to the wife; nor in fine, does it imply that the wife should be put on a level with those persons who in law are called minors, to whom it is not customary to allow free exercise of their rights on account of their lack of mature judgment, or of their ignorance of human affairs. But it forbids that exaggerated liberty which cares not for the good of the family; it forbids that in this body which is the family, the heart be separated from the head to the great detriment of the whole body and the proximate danger of ruin. For if the man is the head, the woman is the heart, and as he occupies the chief place in ruling, so she may and ought to claim for herself the chief place in love.

Again, this submission of wife to husband in its degree and manner may vary according to the different conditions of persons, place, and time. In fact, if the husband neglect his duty, it falls to the wife to take his place in directing the family. But the structure of the family and its fundamental law, established and confirmed by God, must always and everywhere be maintained intact.

With great wisdom Our predecessor, Leo XIII, of happy memory, in the Encyclical on Christian marriage which We have already mentioned, speaking of this order to be maintained between man and wife, teaches: “<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e husband is the chief of the family, and the head of the wife. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e woman, because she is flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, must be subject to her husband and obey him, not indeed, as a servant, but as a companion, so that her obedience shall be wanting in neither honour nor dignity. Since the husband represents Christ, and since the wife represents the Church, let there always be, both in him who commands and in her who obeys, a heavenborn love guiding both in their respective duties.”<a id="_idTextAnchor532"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1543">32</a></span>

<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is quotation is paralleled by similar statements from leaders of every Christian tradition.

Later in this book we will consider the reasons why the social currents of the modern world work against the approach to family life taught in the scriptures and handed on by the Fathers. At this point, it is enough to observe that there are few instances where it is clearer that a change in the approach of Christians is an abandonment of Christian tradition, and not only of tradition, but of every source of authoritative teaching that can lay claim on a Christian.<a id="_idTextAnchor533"></a>

Especially as indications of the teaching tradition, they can be used as evidence for what Jesus and the apostles taught. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey are, in other words, helpful in interpreting scripture. For an example of how they can be useful, see the discussion of deacons and deaconesses in Chapter Five.

<a class="_idFootnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-106-backlink">289†</a>Catholics would consider other materials “canonical” besides the canonical scriptures. Some decisions of councils as well as some statements of popes would be in this category. A canonical decision in a doctrinal controversy, however, or a canonical decision on how to order the life of the church would be authoritative (a “rule” for how to proceed), but it would not be in the same category as inspired, apostolic writings. See Second Vatican Council, <span class="Italic-Caption">Dei Verbum</span>, sec. 21.
