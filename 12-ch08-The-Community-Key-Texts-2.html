<a id="_idIndexMarker468"></a><span class="Drop-Cap">T</span><span class="Opening-Drop-Words">he final key text</span> is <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is passage often does not receive the attention it deserves, possibly because many people have questions about its authorship. However, <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 is one of the passages in the scripture which is clearly concerned with the roles of men and women and which deliberately addresses that topic. Moreover, the passage contains teaching about men and women that is intended to ground the concrete directions which it gives. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is teaching is similar to that found in Ephesians 5 and <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Corinthians 11; it bases the relationship between men and women in God’s creation of the human race. In addition, <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 does not just set forth a particular rule about the way the order between men and women should be expressed. Rather it is concerned with a question that is central to the structure of the roles of men and women—the question of authority and teaching in the community. Finally, <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 is the one passage which clearly addresses the subject of men and women in community leadership and is not also primarily concerned with directions for marriage and family. In short, <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 is one of the most important texts to consider in any examination of the New Testament on the roles of men and women.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<a id="_idIndexMarker469"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker470"></a><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e subject of <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy is primarily “church order” or “community order.”<a id="_idTextAnchor342"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1405">1</a></span> It explains how the communal life of the Christian people should be ordered or patterned so that it can function effectively. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e central focus is “how one ought to behave in the household of God” (3:15). Along with <span class="Lining-Nums">2 </span>Timothy and Titus, <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy could be considered the first of the “church orders,” a genre of writing that includes the <span class="Italic">Didache</span>, the <span class="Italic">Didascalia Apostolorum</span>, the <span class="Italic">Apostolic Church Order</span>, the <span class="Italic">Apostolic Constitutions</span> and many others.<a id="_idTextAnchor343"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1406">2</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e whole letter could be read as instructions to a bishop about how to order and direct the life of a Christian congregation.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy begins with a section about false teachers who propound erroneous doctrine about the law and the Christian’s relationship to the law. In this section, Timothy is exhorted to be vigilant about the teaching that is allowed in the community and he is warned about the presence of false teachers among the Christian people. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e next section, beginning with chapter 2, turns to questions of order within the Christian community. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is section begins with an exhortation to pray for governing officials. It then moves to instruction about the roles of men and women in the community—the passage to be examined below. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e letter continues with instructions about how bishops, deacons, and deaconesses are to be chosen. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese instructions for choosing bishops and deacons include a statement about their wives, indicating that only men were envisaged for these positions. However, the instructions also indicate that women held an important position of leadership in the community. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e letter then proceeds to such topics as the protection of the people from false teachers, the “order” of widows, and the discipline of elders.

<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-SA">
<span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 is a passage about men and women in community leadership, contained in a letter which deliberately treats concerns of community order at some length. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e letter intentionally raises the question of the roles of men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>erefore, it is a conscious directive in the New Testament about how to structure leadership positions among the Christian people in regard to the roles of men and women. At the same time, this passage deals with only a particular aspect of the roles of men and women: the exercise of authority by men and women in leadership of the Christian people. Moreover, the passage seems to have been written to counter some other possible approaches. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>us, one should not read it as a fully balanced, comprehensive picture of the roles of men and women in community service. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e passage should be allowed its full weight in the area it addresses, but it should not be treated as a statement of everything one needs to know about men and women in community service. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e passage reads as follows:

<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-1st">
I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling; also that women should adorn themselves modestly and sensibly in seemly apparel, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly attire but by good deeds, as befits women who profess religion. Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness. I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over men; she is to keep silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet woman will be saved through bearing children, if she continues in faith and love and holiness, with modesty. (<span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Tm 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5)

Let not yours be the outward adorning with braiding of the hair, decora­tion of gold, and wearing of robes, but let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable jewel of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God’s sight is very precious.

<a id="_idIndexMarker472"></a><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e similarities between this part of <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Peter 3 and the section of <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2 that begins with “Also, that women should adorn themselves . . .” are so close that they are undoubtedly more than accidental. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e two sections do not parallel one another exactly, but they contain a similar thought in similar words. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is points to the fact that we are dealing with a standard teaching of the early church for women.<a id="_idTextAnchor345"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1407">3</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e instruction could be summarized as follows: Women should not adorn themselves in expensive or luxurious ways, but should adorn themselves in quietness and subordination. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is teaching is developed and applied differently in the two passages, but the essential similarity is unmistakable.<a id="_idTextAnchor346"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1408">4</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e connection between luxurious adornment and subordination is more direct in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Peter 3:4 than in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:9<span class="No-Break">–1</span>0, but both passages make the connection clearly. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e warning against luxurious adornment was probably made to counter a difficulty which was common to women in the early church. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e exhortation to quietness and subordination was probably a basic instruction routinely given to women, though possibly it too was an attempt to counter a problem (as <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Tm 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 likely was).
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e instruction to women in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2 is preceded by a corresponding instruction to men. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e men are told to avoid conflict and quarreling and are urged to prayer. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e problem corresponding to the women’s tendency to over-adornment was the men’s tendency to quarrel.

</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
We should not place too much emphasis on the exhortation to women to adorn themselves modestly and sensibly. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is exhortation is not the heart of the passage. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e parallel with <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Peter 3 suggests that this exhortation is simply intended to call to mind a standard line of teaching which leads to an exhortation to subordination. Indeed, the following verses in both <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Peter 3 and in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2 treat subordination by itself, with no further reference to dressing modestly. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e writer urges the woman to clothe herself primarily in subordination or in the character traits that support subordination. (See the exposition of <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Peter 3 in Chapter Four.) <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e passage focuses on the question of order, not on women’s tendency to over-adornment or men’s tendency to quarreling.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
However, the warning against over-adornment should not be dismissed, as some modern writers have tended to do. In the epistles, the warning is introduced with seriousness, and probably reiterates a standard teaching among the early Christians. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e passage prohibits expensive and luxurious adornment. <a id="_idIndexMarker473"></a><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e prohibition against braiding of hair does not concern hair braiding as we understand the term today, but instead prohibits an elaborate type of coiffure. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is exhortation is repeated by the Fathers and many of the spiritual writers in later Christian tradition.<a id="_idTextAnchor347"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1409">5</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e admonition is meant seriously, but it nonetheless still serves primarily as an introduction to the main point of the passage—the subordination of woman.

<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e core instruction of <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 lies in verses 11<span class="No-Break">–1</span>2: “Let women learn in quietness in all subordination.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-091-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-091">†</a></span></span> I do not permit woman to teach or to exercise/​usurp authority over man.

Verses 11<span class="No-Break">–1</span>2 contain the rule that is being enjoined. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is is the material we must understand in order to grasp the specific intent of this passage.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<a id="_idIndexMarker474"></a>Each of the key words of verses 11<span class="No-Break">–1</span>2 (“subordination,” “quietness,” “teach,” and “exercise authority”) needs elaboration. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e term “subordination” has already been commented upon (see pp. <a href="08-ch04-The-Family-Key-Texts.html#_idTextAnchor135">81</a><span class="No-Break">–</span><a href="08-ch04-The-Family-Key-Texts.html#_idTextAnchor144"><span class="No-Break">83</span></a>). Here the term could be translated “submissiveness” (see p. <a href="08-ch04-The-Family-Key-Texts.html#_idTextAnchor166">93</a>) as well as “subordination.” “Quietness,” the second word which needs elaboration, is sometimes translated as “silence.” However, the Greek word in 1 Timothy is not the same word as the word for “silence” in <a id="_idIndexMarker475"></a>1 Corinthians 14:33. The word for silence in 1 Corinthians 14 (<span class="Italic">sigaō</span>) is the common word for making no sound. <a id="_idIndexMarker476"></a><span class="Italic">Hēsychia</span>, the word in 1 Timothy 2:11<span class="No-Break">–1</span>2 (the same word found in 1 Pt 3:4) is often translated “calmness,” “peacefulness,” or “quietness.”<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-090-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-090">*</a></span></span> In some passages in the New Testament (e.g., Acts 22:2), <span class="Italic">hēsychia</span> refers to a process of ceasing to make objections or ceasing to be contentious. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e word “quietness” in these passages, then, refers to a condition that would be characteristic of those who are taught and who receive what is being said. In <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>essalonians 4:11, the word is used to denote the quality of being concerned with one’s own affairs and of not trying to handle something that is outside the scope of one’s responsibility. “Quietness” in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy, then, probably refers to a disposition that is ready for learning and is receptive to direction. <span class="Italic">Hēsychia </span>is closely related to subordination and could well be a word for the state or personal bearing that corresponds to genuine subordination or submissiveness—that is, a state of peace, trust, and receptivity. Refusal or a disinclination to accept teaching or direction is the opposite of <span class="Italic">hēsychia</span>. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e term does not necessarily mean refraining from all speech in public situations or in assemblies of the community, but it would mean refraining from speech which would be directive or involve teaching.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<a id="_idIndexMarker493"></a><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e third word needing comment is “teach.”<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-089-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-089">†</a></span></span> “Teach” is a common word in the New Testament and designates an activity of great importance to the early church. <a id="_idIndexMarker494"></a>Contemporary notions of education can be very misleading in attempting to understand the meaning of “teaching” in the New Testament. We most commonly understand teaching as a transfer of information (facts) or skills. Sometimes we also include values within the realm of education, but when we think of teaching values in modern education, we are inclined to conceive the process as helping students to see that some values were important or attractive. Modern “teaching” does not involve the exercise of authority over people, except insofar as the teacher needs to maintain enough discipline to continue teaching. Modern “teaching” is usually a process whereby an expert is hired to transmit a skill or information to students who are free to ignore what is taught.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<a id="_idTextAnchor348"></a><a id="_idTextAnchor349"></a>By contrast, the early Christian understanding of teaching, built upon the Jewish understanding, saw teaching as an activity involving personal direction and an exercise of authority. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e teacher did not just give his views. He laid out what he expected the student to accept.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Moreover, teaching occurred within a relationship in which the teacher had authority over the student. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e focus of teaching in the New Testament was upon teaching a way of life and the truths which underlay that way of life. Students were expected to follow that way of life, and the teaching was passed on with authority. Teachers were either elders, heads of a community or of some grouping within the community, or masters who took in disciples who submitted themselves for formation. Teaching was not a function in which an expert came and performed a service which a client was free to receive or not receive as he wished. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e teaching occurred within a relationship in which the students acknowledged the teacher’s authority. Moreover, authority was primarily exercised within the early church not as much by individual direction, but by teaching given to a body, accompanied by the correction of individuals who were not following the accepted teaching (cf. <a id="_idIndexMarker495"></a><span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Tm 4:11; <a id="_idIndexMarker496"></a>4:16<span class="No-Break">–5</span>:2; <a id="_idIndexMarker497"></a><span class="Lining-Nums">2 </span>Tm 4:1<span class="No-Break">–4</span>; <a id="_idIndexMarker498"></a>Ti 2:15; <a id="_idIndexMarker499"></a>3:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>1). In other words, the scripture views teaching primarily as a governing function, a function performed by elders, masters, and others with positions of government. In this context, the connection between teaching, exercising authority, and being subordinate can be seen more clearly.<a id="_idTextAnchor350"></a>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e final word that needs attention is <a id="_idIndexMarker500"></a><span class="Italic">authentein</span>, which is translated “exercise authority” or “usurp authority.” <span class="Italic">Authentein</span> only occurs once in the New Testament and is never used in the Septuagint, so there is no scriptural background for interpreting its meaning. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e word could simply mean “exercise authority” and is normally translated accordingly. However, because of its etymology, it is possible that <span class="Italic">authentein</span> conveys the notion of exercising authority on one’s own account (without authorization) or on one’s own terms (arbitrarily or autocratically). <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e former sense would point to a translation like “usurp authority,” the latter to a translation like “domineer.”
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e meaning of the passage differs according to whether <span class="Italic">authentein</span> is taken to mean “exercise authority,” “usurp authority,” or “domineer.”<a id="_idTextAnchor351"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1410">6</a></span> If it means simply “exercise authority,” the passage would therefore prohibit all exercise of authority over man by woman. If it means “usurp authority,” there are two possible different interpretations. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e first is that <span class="Italic">authentein</span> (“usurp”) indicates that every time a woman takes authority over a man, she is usurping authority because it does not belong to her. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is too implies that all exercise of authority by woman over man is <span class="Italic">ipso facto</span> wrong. A second possible interpretation of “usurping authority” holds that the passage forbids her to usurp authority over men, that is, to take it in an improper way. According to this interpretation, a woman could be placed in a position of authority over men if done properly. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e passage would then prohibit only usurpers, like Athaliah. Finally, <span class="Italic">authentein</span> could mean “domineer.” If this were its meaning, the passage would only forbid a woman to exercise authority over men if she were doing it in an autocratic way.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e possible meanings of the word <span class="Italic">authentein</span> allow two different interpretations of verses 11<span class="No-Break">–1</span>2. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e first interpretation is that these verses forbid woman’s exercise of authority over man, with the possible implication that every time she does so she is usurping authority. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e second interpretation is that these verses forbid woman to exercise authority over man only when she usurps that authority or exercises it in an arbitrary or domineering way. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e whole passage would then simply be a prohibition of wrongful use of authority over men, not a complete prohibition of woman’s authority over man.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is second interpretation has been developed in a variety of ways. Some have suggested that the passage was aimed at wealthier women who thought their social position guaranteed them a leadership position. Others have speculated that the targets were bossy and domineering women in whose houses the church was meeting, or women who were publicly demeaning their husbands, or untrained or ungifted women who were attempting to act as teachers. <a id="_idIndexMarker501"></a><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ough no one appears to have suggested this, following this second interpretation, the passage could also be directed at women well-versed in Christianity and spiritual matters who felt that they should be teachers despite the fact that they had no gift for leadership nor proper authorization to teach.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e major objection to the second interpretation—that the passage only prohibits wrongful exercise of authority—is the overall construction of the passage. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e prohibition in the passage reads: “Let woman learn in quietness in all subordination. I do not permit woman to teach or to exercise authority over man. She is to remain in quietness.” First, no hint is given here or elsewhere in the passage that the concern is only with some women who are wrongly handling authority. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e passage focuses simply on women; it was preceded by a parallel exhortation to men. Secondly, the terms “teach” and “exercise authority” are parallel. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey are intentionally linked. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e kind of teaching meant in the passage is allied to exercising authority; the kind of exercising authority which is meant is undoubtedly the kind which would accompany teaching. Authority and teaching are also parallel to subordination and quietness. Hence, the passage prohibits woman from taking a position where man is subordinate to her. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e prohibition is not simply directed at some disorderly or untrained women acting improperly.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>irdly, if the ruling was aimed at people wrongly exercising authority, it would be stated in a way that is applicable to men as well as women. Men are not free from such problems. If the writer intended to warn against the wrongful exercise of authority, he would have worded the passage differently—to keep people from supposing that all women are intended and to deal with the men who might fall into the same problem.<a id="_idTextAnchor352"></a>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Finally, these verses about authority and teaching are followed by a justification which involves the story of Adam and Eve—how woman was created in relation to man. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is clearly indicates that the rule concerns something that is out of place because it is women who are doing it, not because women are doing it in the wrong way. In short, the evidence shows that the passage concerns women because they are women and men because they are men. It does not deal with individual women who happen to be handling themselves wrongly. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e passage simply prohibits women from exercising authority over men.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Some hold that the apostle prohibited women’s teaching because they were uneducated, that is, because of a condition universal to women of his day (but no longer true today). However, there is no hint of this in the passage either. If the prohibition was aimed at untrained or uneducated teachers, it would have forbidden both men and women to teach if they were uneducated. In fact, Ephesus was undoubtedly a place where some of the women would have been more educated than many or most of the men. Several educated pagan women held influential positions in society, and the Christian woman Priscilla was well enough educated to instruct an intellectual like Apollos.<a id="_idTextAnchor353"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1411">7</a></span> Women as well as men could have been trained in Christian teaching. Some of the deaconesses and workers in apostolic teams must have received such training. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>us there is no reason to think that the ruling in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 was given to make sure that teachers were educated. It is an instruction that women are not to teach men or exercise authority over men, and it is grounded in the roles associated with the way God created men and women.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<a id="_idIndexMarker502"></a><span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 therefore concerns the role of women in relation to the role of men. It is a passage which gives direction to women because they are women and not because they are untrained or disorderly. Moreover, this passage links teaching and exercising authority to subordination and quietness. In other words, the passage concerns relationships of authority and subordination, and forbids a woman to hold a position of authority over men in the Christian community. Women are not allowed to hold positions of government in the Christian community—positions such as elder/​overseer.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-088-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-088">*</a></span></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e ground which is given for this prohibition in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:11<span class="No-Break">–1</span>2 is subordination based on the way men and women were created. In other words, the grounds lie in the basic social structure of the Christian community as it is ordered in terms of the roles and relationships of men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e passage, then, is a rule that states that those with governmental responsibility in the Christian community should not be women.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Some hold that the phrase “I do not permit” limits this rule. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey argue that one apostle—the writer of <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy—is regulating the churches under his care, possibly in response to a specific disorder, and was not issuing a teaching intended for all Christians.<a id="_idTextAnchor354"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1412">8</a></span> To be sure, the vigor of his words does indicate that the apostle was trying to deal with some disorder and that he was exercising his personal authority. However, this does not mean that he intended his words as a personal ruling applying only to his churches. First, as was pointed out above, the way he states his ruling indicates that he understood it as applying to all women because they are women, not because of some special circumstances—in his churches or among particular women. His situation called for a new assertion of this ruling, either because Christian women were assuming an improper position or because he was worried about the influence of non-Christian women on his people. Asia Minor was the place where women in the ancient world were freest to take positions of leadership and influence.<a id="_idTextAnchor355"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1413">9</a></span> But the statement of the ruling would not in any way indicate that he was dealing with the situation on any other grounds than to assert a ruling that would apply to all women, whether in his churches or in some other.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<a id="_idIndexMarker503"></a><a id="_idTextAnchor356"></a>Secondly, the phrase “I do not permit” no more indicates that the apostle is delivering a personal rule than the phrase “my gospel” in <a id="_idIndexMarker504"></a><span class="Lining-Nums">2 </span>Timothy 2:18 indicates that he had a separate or personal gospel for his own churches. More likely, he used the first person to back up the ruling with his own authority. <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:12, then, is analogous to <a id="_idIndexMarker505"></a><span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Corinthians 11:16 as a passage in which a rule universal to the Christian people is reaffirmed on the basis of the apostle’s own personal authority. It is a personal reaffirmation, given by someone with the necessary personal authority to give such a reaffirmation, based upon universal teaching, and contained in a book probably intended to be something like a church order. All the evidence points to the conclusion that this passage has been preserved for us in the canon of scripture as a basic ruling on the roles of men and women in community leadership. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is is the light in which the patristic commentators viewed <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5.<a id="_idTextAnchor357"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1414">10</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<a id="_idIndexMarker506"></a><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is interpretation leaves us with many questions about the application of the prohibition against women teaching. According to the above interpretation, <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2 does not prohibit all teaching by women. As was observed in Chapter Five, women were expected to teach under certain circumstances and <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2 does not cancel or contradict that expectation.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-087-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-087">*</a></span></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is passage prohibits women from holding positions of authority in the Christian community such that men would be subordinate to them. It reserves to men the kind of teaching which is an exercise of authority over men or over the community as a whole. However, there remain serious questions of application. <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:12 has been used as an argument against allowing women to teach Sunday school or catechism and against their entrance into theological schools. It is difficult to see which of these would conflict with the passage and which not. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e difficulty in applying the passage does not arise from an unclarity in the meaning of the passage, but from the difference between the approach to teaching taken by the modern church (and the modern world) and the approach of the early Christians. Teaching today is less a way of exercising authority in a relationship, and more an indoctrination or a transfer of information. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>erefore, it is difficult to understand in many situations which contemporary teaching would qualify as the kind of teaching the passage is concerned with. Such issues of application will be considered in the later chapters of this book. At this point it is enough to note that the rule in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy states clearly that men are to exercise governmental authority in the Christian community, and the kind of teaching discussed in the epistle is an expression of the exercise of that authority.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-086-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-086">*</a></span></span>

Like other key texts, this passage turns to Genesis and God’s purposes in creation. Two reasons from Genesis are summoned to justify the rule: First, that Adam was formed before Eve; and, second, that Adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e first reason is possibly the main one since it is given first. <a id="_idIndexMarker509"></a><span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Corinthians 11:8<span class="No-Break">–9</span> gives the same reason for woman having man as her head. <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Corinthians 11 emphasizes woman’s origins from man and being created for him, while <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2 emphasizes precedence.

</h3>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI-SA">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e introduction of the deception of the first woman into the argument is troublesome for many. First, it appears to lay the whole blame for the Fall on woman. Eve is not blamed for the Fall anywhere else in the New Testament.<a id="_idTextAnchor359"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1415">11</a></span> Paul’s primary teaching lays the main responsibility on Adam, not on the woman:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
As sin came into the world through one man and death through sin . . . For if many died through one man’s trespass . . . If, because of one man’s trespass, death reigned through that one man . . . <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>en, as one man’s trespass led to condemnation for all men . . . For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners . . . (Rom 5:12, 15, 17, 18, 19)
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
To be sure, the stress on “one man” is intended to provide a basis for the comparison with the one man, Christ, the one of whom Adam is the type. Nonetheless, the main responsibility for the Fall must belong to Adam as the father of the race.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Some hold that the difference between the teaching in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:14 and that in Romans 5 is so great that it proves that Paul did not write <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy, since he takes a position incompatible with the position in Romans.<a id="_idTextAnchor360"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1416">12</a></span> Whatever judgment one makes about the authorship of <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy, such a view misunderstands the statement in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:14. It is, in fact, compatible with Romans 5. For the argument developed in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:13<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5, as well as that in Romans 5, is that it would be an embarrassment for the woman to assume the main responsibility for the family and to bear the main burden of the guilt. Such an understanding would cut as much at the view of the man-woman relationship expressed in the statement “Adam was formed first, then Eve” as it would at the first Adam<span class="No-Break">–s</span>econd Adam typology in Romans 5. Actually, verse 14 does not state that the woman bears the main responsibility for the Fall. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e verse rather states only that the woman was deceived. Being deceived was her role in the Fall, and that fact affects the appropriateness of women teaching and exercising authority. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e question of the main responsibility for turning away from God is not addressed in the passage. One could presume, from his precedence and consequent governing authority, that man bore the final responsibility and hence for the author of <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy as well sin came into the world through a male. However, all that is explicitly stated is that Adam was not deceived—a fact which might well have been seen by the author as increasing, not decreasing, Adam’s responsibility. In short, the view expressed in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:14 is at least compatible with Romans 5.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Some find the role of the deception of the woman in the argument of <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 as problematic because it bases the subordination of woman to man on the results of the Fall. If a rule about the roles of men and women is based on the “curses” that were given as a result of the Fall, then the rule should be reversed by the work of Christ. Here again the problem is a supposed inconsistency between <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:8<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 and the rest of New Testament teaching or between this passage and other epistles that a particular commentator holds as authentically Pauline. Such considerations in their various forms do not rest upon a careful understanding of <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:14<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5. In fact, Paul does not found the subordination of woman on the consequences of the Fall, but on creation.<a id="_idTextAnchor361"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1417">13</a></span> His appeal is primarily to the fact that man was created first.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<a id="_idTextAnchor362"></a>Verses 14<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 do concern the Fall and its consequences, but they do not justify the difference in roles between men and women or prohibit women from teaching by appealing to the consequences of the Fall or to the “curses.” Rather, verses 14<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 refer to a condition that was a cause of the Fall rather than a result of the Fall. Verse 15, as will be discussed further on, possibly affirms that the work of Christ overcomes the consequences of the Fall, but without implying that the redemption abrogates the role difference between men and women. Women’s “deception,” as stated by verse 14, did not occur before the Fall, but it was the first step of the Fall and occurred well before the human race faced the judgment of God or began to suffer the consequences of the Fall. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e point made by <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:14 actually rests on the fact that it was Eve as she was created to be who was deceived. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e verse simply states that the first woman, created the way God intended her to be, was deceived.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-085-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-085">*</a></span></span>

<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is fact, then, is given as grounds for the rule that woman should not teach or exercise authority over man. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere are two acceptable explanations for this line of reasoning.<a id="_idTextAnchor363"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1418">14</a></span> One common explanation holds that <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:14 teaches that women are more easily deceived than men.<a id="_idTextAnchor364"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1419">15</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is explanation can also be rephrased in a less negative way. According to such an approach, <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:14 states that woman is more influenceable (open) or susceptible to spiritual influences than man.<a id="_idTextAnchor365"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1420">16</a></span> In some circumstances this quality makes her more easily deceived.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-084-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-084">*</a></span></span> In other circumstances, however, the quality makes her more open to faith. Men’s greater ability to resist deception makes them more capable of being a governor of the community and of maintaining the teaching of the community. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey are better able to achieve one of the main purposes of those with governing authority: to provide stability and to protect the community against alien spiritual influences and deception. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ose who hold such a view will often argue that history supports their interpretation. Shortly after <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy was written (perhaps even at the very time it was being written), women took a prominent role in Gnostic sects, a more prominent role than the one they held in the leadership among orthodox Christians. Women were similarly prominent in the development of Montanism. A case can be made for the view that women can be found clustering around new spiritual movements, both good and bad, in greater numbers than men.<a id="_idTextAnchor366"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1421">17</a></span> In short, one could reasonably hold that women have been historically more open to spiritual influences than men, and that they have been less inclined than men to concern themselves with establishing good order and sound doctrine.

<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
However, there is another way to understand the statement “the woman was deceived,” a way which does not rely on empirical evidence for accepting the truth of the statement. Contemporary people who see the statement “the woman was deceived” as the basis of a role difference are inclined to look immediately for empirical evidence for it. Many accept the account of Adam and Eve as a revelation, but are not inclined to argue from it as the basis of a practice or rule in human relationships unless they can see that it has an empirical foundation. Hence one would ask about the sense in which woman is more deceivable than man and expect evidence for the assertion. Jewish or Christian writers in the New Testament period, however, would be more inclined to think typologically. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>at is, they would look at the pattern as presented in Genesis (or anywhere else in revelation) and see that pattern as a standard for later practice. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e writer of <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy notes that “(the) woman was deceived,” not “woman is deceivable.” <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e typological mode of thought would assume that if the woman was deceived and not the man, then the scripture must be indicating something about the place of women. Otherwise, scripture would not have preserved that feature in the story. Eve is a type of “woman” and the fact that she was deceived is a part of this portrayal. It is a fact which a typological mode of thought would see as a basis for what “woman” should do or not do. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>erefore, <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2 might not be concerned with the deceivability of woman, but simply with the fact that “the woman was deceived.”<a id="_idTextAnchor367"></a>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Typological thinking and empirical generalization are two different modes of thought. Typological thinking focuses on the concrete event—the “type” which reveals the general purpose or intention of God. Empirical generalization focuses on verifiable facts and observed regularities. Contemporary people are rarely satisfied simply with a typological approach. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey want to know the empirical consequences of a typological consideration. For example, does the statement “the woman was deceived” imply that “women are more deceivable than men”?<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-083-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-083">*</a></span></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is issue will be taken up again in Chapter Sixteen. At this point it is enough to note that the interpretation of the statement “the woman was deceived” does not necessarily imply that “women are more deceivable than men (in certain circumstances).” <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e human author himself might have simply intended a typological consideration when he wrote the passage, a consideration which in his view was adequate to establish the purpose of God for the roles of men and women.

<span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:14<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 contains another difficult sentence: “yet woman will be saved through bearing children, if she continues in faith and love and holiness with modesty.” Some have found this verse difficult because they think it defines the whole destiny of woman as childbearing.

<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e sentence should be translated “she will be saved by child bearing” or even “she will be saved by motherhood,” meaning either (a) that childbearing is salvific for her or (b) that childbearing is so much part of her call that she will find salvation in fulfilling this call (in the sense that one is saved by fulfilling faithfully and righteously the duties of one’s station in life).<a id="_idTextAnchor368"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1422">18</a></span>

</li>
</ol>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
An analysis of the merits of these four interpretations goes beyond the scope of this book. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e passage is difficult and probably none of the interpretations will ever be established definitively. However, two observations will prove helpful. First, the notion that childbearing is salvific for women would indeed be at odds with the central teaching of the New Testament that salvation is through Jesus Christ. However, this is a highly uncertain interpretation and it is a fragile basis for an assertion that <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2 is at odds with the rest of the New Testament. Given the seriousness of the contradiction being posited, it would be more responsible to view the conflict between this interpretation and the rest of early Christian teaching (including the rest of <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy) as evidence that the interpretation is unlikely. Secondly, the weight of the various interpretations see <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:15 as an assertion that childbearing itself is not cursed (as one might believe from Gn 3:16), or as an assertion that the Lord will protect woman in the very area where she is experiencing the painful consequences of her transgression. In other words, <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:15 is probably a qualification, somewhat akin to <a id="_idIndexMarker516"></a><span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Corinthians 11:11<span class="No-Break">–1</span>2, to prevent readers from misunderstanding a teaching that could be viewed as negative toward the spiritual position of women or toward childbearing. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is view is supported by the overall context of <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy—the letter counters currents that depreciated sex and marriage. <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:15 is not a passage which sees the destiny of women or the salvation of women in childbearing and motherhood, but instead is essentially a passage which safeguards the spiritual worth of childbearing and motherhood.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Finally, <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:1<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5 does not base its approach to the structure of the Christian community on the defectiveness of woman. Woman’s way of falling is no more an indication of her innate defectiveness than man’s way of falling. Both man and woman were created with different roles and different strengths and weaknesses. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eir characteristic weaknesses played their roles in the Fall. Being deceived was the way woman is vulnerable; disobedience was the way man is vulnerable (Rom 5:19). <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2 does not imply that woman is more defective than man, but that they are defective in different ways. To be truer to the text (since the text is not concerned with defectiveness), we should say that man and woman are different from one another and have different roles in the life of the Christian people and in the plan of salvation as well as different points of vulnerability. <a id="_idIndexMarker517"></a>Woman functions in complementarity to man. She complemented him in the Fall, to the misfortune of the human race, and she complemented him in redemption, to the blessing of the human race. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e former showed her weakness, the latter her strength.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e New Testament places an importance upon woman’s complementary role to the role of man in the plan of redemption, an importance that is a different illustration of the same underlying reality being asserted in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:14. Woman was the one deceived because she was the first to believe the serpent. But woman was also the first to believe God in the redemption. In the resurrection account, it is the women who first come to believe in the resurrection. Peter and the apostles do not believe them at first. It is undoubtedly significant either that the women were the first to believe or that the scripture preserved the memory that they were. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e woman’s faith in the event that overcame the Fall corresponds to her position in the Fall.<a id="_idTextAnchor372"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1426">22</a></span> Moreover, the man’s role in the resurrection corresponds to his role in the Fall. Just as it was not until the man who was the head of the race joined his wife in transgression that the whole human race fell, so it was not until the apostles, the men with the governing responsibility for the group of disciples, joined the women in faith that the Christian people found new life in the resurrection.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Another example of the same truth can be found at the beginning of the gospel in the birth of Jesus. Luke presents two people who receive an annunciation from an angel: Zechariah and Mary.<a id="_idTextAnchor373"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1427">23</a></span> Zechariah disbelieves the message and is struck dumb as a result. Mary receives the message with faith and submission. Consequently, according to the teaching of many of the Fathers, Mary became the new Eve, the one who reversed what Eve had done.<a id="_idTextAnchor374"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1428">24</a></span> By accepting the word of God, she became the one who bore the messiah who was the savior of the world. It was only through a woman that God became man, and not a disobedient or deceived woman, but a woman of faith and submission. She was saved by her son, like the rest of the human race, but her role in his birth gave her the position of the new Eve. God’s plan was not to save the human race apart from woman (<a id="_idIndexMarker518"></a><span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Cor 11:11), but to save the human race with a savior born of woman (<a id="_idIndexMarker519"></a>Gal 4:4).
