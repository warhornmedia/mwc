<p class="BODY-STYLES_Subhead-Opening">
<span class="MaWiC_Subhead-Drop-Words"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is</span> book is designed to answer the question of what Christians should do about the roles of men and women in the modern world. Consequently, it touches on a great many areas, each of which has been written about extensively. A book such as this cannot survey all the relevant material in each area.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
On the other hand, this book is written in the conviction that a broader perspective is needed than that which is normally provided by most of those who write about social roles. Most of the books which advocate an approach to the roles of men and women do so without adequately surveying the relevant material on the subject. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey rely heavily upon one author or a school of authors in controversial areas without seeming to realize that there are other valid approaches and without justifying their own choice of approach. As the Notes on Method will attempt to establish, feminist authors are particularly guilty of this, probably because their purpose is polemical.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
A broader survey would also be helpful for scholarly writers who touch on the area of social roles for men and women. Much exegesis would be done differently, for instance, if exegetes were more aware of the work of social historians on the differences between traditional and technological society. Many exegetes would probably treat Paul’s arguments from Genesis differently if they had before them all the relevant modern social scientific data on the biological origin of the differences between men and women.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e approach adopted in these footnotes is a “survey” approach. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e survey is reasonably complete for all the major works on approaches to the roles of men and women in the modern world up to the date of the completion of the text, and it is complete on the works those books draw upon. It is, in other words, a complete survey of all the significant works which play a part in the current discussion of social roles for men and women.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
In addition, the survey covers the current scholarly approaches to the various areas touched upon in the argument of the text, even when these approaches are not represented in the current discussion of social roles. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese notes do not try to present the history of the discussion in these areas. Neither do they attempt to be as complete in surveying works not written or translated into English unless the English sources indicate the importance of a work available only in another language.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e contribution of this book does not lie in original research. Rather, it lies in the framework of concepts and arguments that makes possible the assessing of different bodies of literature and thought. Perhaps it also lies in showing how much is being neglected or ignored in the current discussion of the roles of men and women.

His purpose in drawing such a sharp distinction is to distinguish between sexuality (i.e., being men and women) and marriage, and to assert that it is sexuality which is of primary significance here, and marriage as an expression of sexuality is only of secondary importance. While the distinction is important for him, it is not important for our purposes. His reflection on these passages, however, is accurate. He says, “In other words, in the Old Testament as a whole the presupposition of marriage merges with the reality of marriage. In the Jewish scriptures, the man and the woman in their mutual relationship are viewed almost exclusively as husband and wife, as father and mother.” <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is observation is correct from the exegetical viewpoint. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Old Testament clearly views marriage and family life (including reproduction) as the purpose for which God made man male and female. However, to attempt to separate v. 24 from v. 23 and to say that the narrative represents a more primitive view and the following verse contains a subsequent and secondary theological reflection is to make a division in the text which seems unwarranted.

Hence it would adopt the view as a premise of biblical theology that the Bible has a unity and that the role of biblical theology is to state that unity either for the Bible as a whole, or for parts of it, or for an aspect of “Biblical thought.” Heinrich Schlier expresses such an approach forcefully in “<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Meaning and Function of a <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eology of the New Testament,” in Herbert Vorgrimler, <span class="Italic">Dogmatic vs. Biblical <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eology</span> (London: Burns and Oates, 1964), 90<span class="No-Break">–9</span>4.

For the most part, however, any approach to biblical theology makes the Bible itself a central concern. Here, the concern is with the teaching which the Bible gives on a subject, and hence exegetical and descriptive material is only brought in insofar as it clarifies the message of the New Testament as to what should be the social roles of men and women.

Barth, 612, gives a survey of interpretations of “as to the Lord.” Among them he mentions that the phrase can indicate both the urgency and the limit of the wives’ subordination. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is interpretation falls under the first category mentioned in the text. Two other interpretations Barth offers (first, that wives give way to husbands in the same unrestricted manner as to Christ—in everything; and secondly, that a wife’s subordination to the husband and to Christ are as inseparable as love of God and love of neighbor), are closely related—the latter being a strong version of the former. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese two interpretations apply to the second general category mentioned in the text. Barth mentions two other unlikely interpretations in his survey. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e notion offered by some that “Lord” should not be capitalized, and that it actually refers to the husband (i.e., “as to your lord”) is unlikely, both because of the grammar involved, and because the whole context of the passage involves a comparison of the marriage relationship with that of Christ the Lord and his Church. A further unlikely interpretation is that the phrase indicates that submission is exclusively to Christ, in such a way that the husband is a mere vehicle or occasion for expressing submission to Christ. See the comments in the text on the faultiness of this interpretation (pp. <a href="08-ch04-The-Family-Key-Texts.html#_idTextAnchor129">79</a><span class="No-Break">–</span><a href="08-ch04-The-Family-Key-Texts.html#_idTextAnchor131"><span class="No-Break">80</span></a>).

Sampley, 144, points out that the two verbs together produce a generalization, signifying that the husband “does everything possible to take care of” his wife. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e first verb is also used in Ephesians 6:4 in context of the parent-child relationship, while the second verb appears in 1 <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>essalonians 2:7, also in a context of caring for children.

On the other hand, Barth states, 621, “it is improper to explain the words ‘in everything’ by compiling a short or long list of exemptions to prove that ‘in everything’ actually means ‘not in everything.’” See also Sampley’s comments on this phrase, 126, which follow in a similar vein.

As Sampley states: “when a substantive like <span class="Italic">mystērion</span> is used six times in such crucial places as it is in Ephesians, there is considerable probability of some lines of continuity of meaning between the uses in the different contexts” (91). <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e two views, however, are not mutually exclusive.

For instance, the <span class="Italic">Didascalia Apostolorum</span> draws the strongest parallel between the deacon and deaconess. But the <span class="Italic">Didascalia</span> is written for a small church in which there were either no elders apart from the bishop or elders who were not particularly active in caring for the congregation. All the “work” was done by the bishop and deacons and deaconesses. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e deaconesses were very much like deacons, to be sure, but undoubtedly the deacons were more like elders than they were in other situations.

</p>

However imperiously Paul the apostle may demand a hearing for Christ, however ingenuously he may put himself forward as a pattern for imitation, yet he cannot simply give orders. . . . <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey must themselves recognize in his instructions the ‘standard of teaching’ to which they are committed, and to which Paul in a sense merely “recalls” them, in order that they may affirm it for themselves, and freely and joyfully make it their own once more.

<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>at surely cannot be an accurate picture. . . . His apostolic power in no way makes him dependent on the “freedom of the community” to follow him.

While the term “apostle” was primarily a governmental term in New Testament times, to designate the Twelve, Paul, and probably some others, it is not clear that all who were called “apostles” in the New Testament had a governmental role (see footnote on p. <a href="09-ch05-The-People-Service-and-Position.html#_idTextAnchor238">130</a> for a possible exception). <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e title as a governmental function was not used after the New Testament until it was revived by certain Protestant churches like the Irvingites. Gradually the term was used more for those who first brought Christianity or the gospel message somewhere and therefore used more in the sense of “evangelist.” In this meaning it was later commonly applied to women. St. Nino was called the “apostle of Georgia.” <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e title “apostle to the apostles” was given by some to Mary Magdalene in the middle ages, because she first told the apostles about the resurrection. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e relation of the Twelve and others termed “apostles” as well as other possible distinctions among apostles or views about apostles in the early literature are beyond the scope of this work and do not affect the basic considerations here as long as the governmental nature of the apostolic position is recognized.

It is interesting to note how recent is the “discovery” of Galatians 3:28 as the major scriptural teaching on men and women. Most of the books written on the subject of men and women before 1955 either do not give it consideration as a passage concerning the roles of men and women, or only mention it in passing. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e passage does seem to have been used as a key text on men-women roles by some earlier Evangelicals fighting for women’s emancipation (e.g., Jessie Penn-Lewis in <span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Magna Carta of Women</span> [Minneapolis: Bethany Fellowship, 1975], 99), and by some sects in the past such as the Quintillianists.

<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Block-Quote-Single">
Because these two perspectives—the Jewish and the Christian—are incompatible, there is no satisfying way to harmonize the Pauline argument for female subordination with the larger Christian vision of which the great apostle to the Gentiles was himself the primary architect. It appears from the evidence that Paul himself sensed that his view of the man/​woman relationship, inherited from Judaism, was not altogether congruous with the gospel he preached.

Some of that recoiling comes from a deeply ingrained commitment to abolish the institution of slavery. Much of it, however, comes from a failure to understand how different the institution of slavery could be in different times and places. <span class="Italic">Uncle Tom’s Cabin</span> and other expressions of modern slavery do not well represent all forms of slavery. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e slavery of an Israelite to an Israelite master, as described in the Pentateuch (Ex 21:2<span class="No-Break">–1</span>1; Dt 14:12<span class="No-Break">–1</span>8), was more like being an indentured servant than like being a full slave. Moreover, in Hellenistic kingdoms, in fact in many ancient kingdoms, the highest ministers were slaves of the king. Slaves were not only menial servants or workers, they were also stewards, set over the estate of the master. Such stewards could be both powerful and respected. In many societies, slaves had legal protection and could expect care from their master. In short, Paul might well have reacted to <span class="Italic">Uncle Tom’s Cabin</span> the same way nineteenth-century Americans did and still not have seen it as representative of the slavery of his day.

<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e considerations and explanations advanced by Paul in the <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Cor 11 passage appear strange to us of modern times not only because we are unable to determine with finality the custom to which Paul refers, but also because the people of Paul’s day felt much more keenly than do people of our day that the outward demeanor of a person is an expression of his inner life, specifically his religious convictions and moral attitude. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e arguments of Paul will be rightly understood and appreciated only when the attempts of Corinthian women to lay aside the headcloth are recognized as an attack upon the structure of marriage, and, as such, an attack in general upon the relations between man and woman as established in creation.

Some view the concern in the passage as “legalism,” and therefore certainly not Pauline (Walker, 106). Such a view is an arbitrary interpretation of Paul’s concerns. Paul chooses where to make rulings (e.g., <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Cor 5; 7; 14) and where not to make them, depending upon his approach and the importance he attaches to a particular practice.

For instance, Cyril of Alexandria, who stated that “woman, too, is indeed in God’s image and likeness, but as by means of the man, so that in a way she is distinguished a little in reference to nature” (<span class="Italic">PG</span> 74:881).

</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Fathers resolved the issue of whether woman was in the image of God in a variety of ways, which generally depended upon their interpretation of the word “image.” Ambrose (<span class="Italic">PL</span> 16:307ff.), Augustine (<span class="Italic">PL</span> 34:452f.), Basil (<span class="Italic">PG</span> 31:240f.), Gregory of Nazianzus (<span class="Italic">PG</span> 36:289<span class="No-Break">–2</span>92), Gregory of Nyssa (<span class="Italic">PG</span> 44:181), Origen (<span class="Italic">GCS </span>10:252), and many others, see “image” as referring in some way or other to one’s essential nature and therefore hold that woman as well as man is in God’s image. On the other hand, John Chrysostom (<span class="Italic">PG</span> 53:73), and others of the Antiochene school such as Diodore of Tarsus (<span class="Italic">PG</span> 33:1546f.) understand “image” to be a functional term referring to man’s ruling position. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey state that woman is not in God’s image according to this functional sense.

In short, the passage in <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Corinthians 11 does not rule out woman’s being in the image of God, and both Genesis 1 and Galatians 3:28 would call for her being in the image of God.

In all his pronouncements concerning the position of woman, Paul’s central concern is for the preservation and protection of marriage. . . .

<a id="_idTextAnchor1431"></a><a href="14-Note-on-Method-Exegesis.html#_idTextAnchor391" class="Endnote-Number-Float">3.</a> In theory, modern discussions about hermeneutics should be concerned with this process, because of their focus on relating the horizon of the author to the horizon of the modern reader and being able to show the meaning of the text within the context of the reader’s actual experience. For the most part, the hermeneutical question is more accurately related to questions of applicability and hence is treated in Chapter Twenty. In fact, however, as hermeneutical theory correctly observes, “prior understandings,” including those concerning application, affect exegesis. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e discussions connected with Bultmann, Fuchs, Ebeling, and others raise the hermeneutical question. However, their discussions seem to produce little useful material for the discussion of the roles of men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is is perhaps another instance of what Walter Wink in <span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Bible in Human Transformation</span> (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1973), 1, would consider the inability of modern exegetical study to fulfill its purpose of relating the scripture to the lives of modern Christians, or what Peter Stuhlmacher in <span class="Italic">Historical Criticism and <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eological Interpretation of Scripture</span> (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1977), 65, describes as the way “historical criticism is the agent of a repeated and growing rupture of vital contact between biblical tradition and our own time.”
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
One reason why most discussions proceeding from considerations of “the hermeneutical question” do not produce much for our area is possibly the fact that their concern is more with interpreting the kerygmatic or doctrinal parts of scripture, not scriptural teaching on Christian life. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e latter area presents a different problematic. A more significant reason, however, in the current context is the general lack of attention given in such hermeneutical discussions to concrete questions of intercultural comparison. Perhaps if the discussions of hermeneutical theory had originated more from the influence of anthropological studies on scripture scholars and less from the influence of philosophical theories such as those of Gadamer and Ricoeur, the approach and results would have been different.

What is characteristic of each of these is that they subject the scriptural interpretation to an ideal of political, economic, and/or sexual liberation.

Many liberationist theologians ground their position in the revisionist Marxist sociology of knowledge of Jürgen Habermas and others of the Frankfurt School. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey would agree with Bonino when he writes: “. . . this theology, with its insistence on praxis and the sociopolitical context as privileged theological <span class="Italic">data</span>, gives the historical circumstances a determinative weight in theology” (Jose Miguel Bonino, <span class="Italic">Doing <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eology in a Revolutionary Situation</span> [Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1975], 72).

For instance, the story of Martha and Mary in Luke 10 is sometimes used as an illustration of a woman doing woman’s work (Martha) and a woman taking a man’s place (Mary). Among those taking this position are A. Swidler, <span class="Italic">Woman in a Man’s Church</span>, 37<span class="No-Break">–3</span>8; Mollenkott, 18<span class="No-Break">–1</span>9; and J. M. Ford, “Tongues<span class="No-Break">–L</span>eadership<span class="No-Break">–W</span>omen,” 194<span class="No-Break">–1</span>97. According to such an interpretation, Jesus was commending Mary for not being bound by feminine jobs. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is interpretation distorts the story. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e concern of the story is to show that the “one thing necessary”—hearing Jesus and learning from him—is more important than “much serving.” Jesus chooses two women to make this point, and his choice is a significant indication of his desire to include women among those he taught. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e point is that Jesus is commending a woman for valuing him and his teaching, not for being “liberated” from traditionally feminine tasks. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e concern of the passage is not with sexual division of labor in work. Rather, its implication for the relations between man and woman is that in Jesus’ view there is no secondary religious status for women in Israel.
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e story in Luke 7 of the woman Jesus forgives is sometimes cited as an instance of radical innovation. It is said that when Jesus let himself be touched by a woman, he broke with all custom in the area of men-women relations. However, none of the people surrounding Jesus seem to notice this aspect of the incident. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eir concern is with the fact that the woman is a “sinner” and that Jesus allows himself to associate with her, even to be touched by her. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e issue in the passage is not raised by the fact that she was a woman (except insofar as she may have been a prostitute, and getting too close to a prostitute might be a source of temptation for a man). <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e issue is raised by the fact that Jesus was willing to ignore some Pharisaic teachings to do his work. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e focus of this passage is not Jesus’ relations with women, but Jesus’ forgiveness of sins and his willingness to associate with sinners for the sake of their salvation. If anything, this passage bears more directly on Jesus’ relations to the Pharisees than on his relations to women. Among those overly focused on Jesus’ relations with women in this passage are Wahlberg, 100<span class="No-Break">–1</span>07, and Kress, 63<span class="No-Break">–6</span>4. Being too sensitive to what now are called “women’s issues” can lead to missing the point or seeing the passage anachronistically in a framework alien to the minds of Jesus and the gospel writer.

It does seem that at times the Christians would avoid a practice simply because it was pagan. On the other hand, it also seems that at times the Christians would take up a pagan practice and change its significance in order to counter pagan influences. However, such concerns both to reject and to take up pagan practices seemed to motivate Christians primarily in the area of worship forms where a symbol, ritual action, or confessional formula might have led new believers to be confused about what God they were worshiping or what kind of worship was fitting. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e early Christians did try to guard against syncretism. But the same phenomenon does not seem to have operated in the area of social structure considerations. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere is no evidence that the early Christians avoided certain approaches to personal relations and social structure to avoid confusing new Christians about the difference between Christianity and paganism. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey did avoid certain approaches to personal relations and social structure that were characteristic of pagans because they thought such approaches were wrong, but not because they thought the practice would cause confusion of religions. However, the major objection to the theory of cultural adaptation in reverse is the lack of evidence for it. It has no more support in the key texts than the theories of cultural adaptation. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere is no indication that in these texts New Testament writers were attempting to keep their female converts from relapsing into paganism. Such a view has to be counted as an unlikely guess. Moreover, presumably if Paul guided male converts who were used to male leadership in pagan cults to approach their new religion differently than they had approached their old, he could have done the same for women.

Richard Niebuhr in his influential and overall helpful book <span class="Italic">Christ and Culture</span>, provides an example of this difficulty in chapter 2 (“Christ Against Culture”). He relies throughout the book on the universal sense of “culture” as human life insofar as it is developed by human beings and not simply given in an instinctual or semi-instinctual way by “nature” rather than using “culture” to refer to the way of life of particular cultures (see the discussion in the text, pp. <a href="17-ch11-The-New-Testament-Approach-Setting-and-Culture.html#_idTextAnchor479">277</a><span class="No-Break">–</span><a href="17-ch11-The-New-Testament-Approach-Setting-and-Culture.html#_idTextAnchor483"><span class="No-Break">279</span></a>). Hence, he does not clearly enough observe that Christians who were against “culture” were not against culture in general, but against the pagan culture that surrounded them. In fact, those who were most against pagan culture wanted to create a distinctly Christian culture.
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e same point could be made by saying that Niebuhr does not approach the issue sociologically or anthropologically (i.e., in terms of a Christian group and culture versus a pagan group or culture). Hence he does not clearly enough treat some of the important aspects of the question.
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
Because of his basic framework, Niebuhr and others like him miss the great difference between the challenge of culture in a Christendom context (where culture is often approached as an element within a Christian society that has a relationship to religion) and the challenge of culture outside a Christendom situation (where “culture” often presents itself as the culture of an alien, unbelieving group). Niebuhr’s book, therefore, is more valuable as a study of theological thought in a Christendom situation than as a study of the Christian approach in missionary situations—the context of the New Testament writings.

Not all early Christian writers are helpful as witnesses to tradition but, in general, early Christian writers of good reputation who appear to be giving accounts of what they understood to be Christian teaching passed on from the apostles can be of assistance in understanding what the scriptures say. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere is an important sense in which the earliest tradition is more helpful and authoritative than later tradition, because an earlier writer is more likely to have received and preserved an undistorted version. For this reason, later teachers have given special weight to the writings of the patristic age. It is sometimes pointed out that later tradition is often more clearsighted on particular issues than is earlier tradition, partly as a result of more reflection over the centuries and partly because of having issues clarified in the course of various controversies. Some would hold, therefore, that later teaching is more reliable. Catholics and Orthodox hold that some issues have been solemnly and deliberately decided by the teaching authority of the whole church and that such elements in later tradition are therefore more authoritative and reliable than many elements in earlier tradition. All other things being equal, however, in the case of a “chain” of tradition over the centuries, an earlier authority has more weight simply because it is earlier and there is less likelihood of distortion. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e primary focus of these chapters, therefore, is with the earliest tradition, the tradition of the patristic era.

Tavard’s description of Chrysostom’s views on women is an example of the resulting distortion. Tavard, 82, says of Chrysostom that he “frequently falls into bad taste,” that his work on remarriage is “particularly savage,” but that he becomes “more human when he addresses himself to one particular person.” Such comments demonstrate a failure to understand or to accurately analyze the mind of this Father of the church, partly because of proceeding from the view that all who hold a role difference between men and women must be undervaluing women, partly for reasons treated toward the end of this chapter.

In this sense it is analogous to the authority of a father over his children which likewise is founded in the nature of the relationship. For this same reason, even though the term “authority” is “legal,” it is more than legal. It expresses an important aspect of many personal relationships.

Dungan, “<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e New Testament Canon in Recent Study,” <span class="Italic">Interpretation</span> 29, no. 4 [October 1, 1975]: 339<span class="No-Break">–3</span>51, for a good survey of this area), but more importantly calling into question scriptural material already received as canonical. Some researchers would consider significant portions of the New Testament as non-canonical in fact. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eir approach would logically call for a new New Testament. One reason that a new canon constructed along these lines has not been published is the fact that the criterion of selection differs from scholar to scholar. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere would be little agreement among them as to what should be considered canonical and what not.
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere are also many who simply deny the authority of scripture, yet claim to be presenting a Christian approach. For an example of a straightforward denial of the authority of scripture see Robin Scroggs, “Tradition, Freedom and the Abyss,” in <span class="Italic">New <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eology No. 8</span>, ed. Martin E. Marty and Dean G. Peerman (New York: Macmillan, 1971), 86<span class="No-Break">–8</span>7. He states, “Neither from a theological nor from a historical point of view can there be the slightest hope of claiming the New Testament as canon” (92). Others would accept the New Testament as the canon, but in fact deny it any normativeness other than that which each Christian reader gives it. Ernst Käsemann presents such an approach in “<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Canon of the New Testament and the Unity of the Church” in <span class="Italic">Essays on New Testament <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>emes</span> (London: SCM Press, 1964), 95<span class="No-Break">–1</span>07. Dennis Nineham in <span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Use and the Abuse of the Scripture</span> (London: Macmillan, 1976) presents a more fully developed view of such an approach. Gregory Baum in “<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Bible as Norm,” in <span class="Italic">New Horizons</span> (New York: Paulist, 1972), provides a Catholic example. Barr in <span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Bible</span> works to reestablish a concept of canonicity that would be acceptable to most modern scholars. He expounds the view that the scripture contains the classical model for the Christian faith and asserts that faith must “relate itself to classically-expressed models” in order to be Christian (118). He recognizes the chaos that Christianity would be in without any canon, but is unable to provide it with enough authority to effectively function as a norm. His article “<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Authority of Scripture,” <span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Ecumenical Review</span> 21, no. 2 (April 1969): 135<span class="No-Break">–1</span>66, provides a good synopsis of current challenges to scriptural authority.

<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
Neoorthodoxy is more difficult to locate in relation to these issues. It attempted to bridge the gap between the traditional and Liberal interpretations of scripture by accommodating the modern critical approach of the Liberals to a more traditional understanding of scripture. Its champions held that, although scripture could be said to contain God’s word and revelation, not all of scripture was God’s word. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is attempted accommodation was ultimately unsuccessful. For good critiques of this attempt see Langdon Gilkey, <span class="Italic">Naming the Whirlwind</span> (New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1969), 80<span class="No-Break">–1</span>01; Childs, 103<span class="No-Break">–1</span>04; Barr, <span class="Italic">Fundamentalism</span>, 213ff.
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e result of the denial of the authority of scripture among many modern scholars is the loss of a consensus about the substance of Christianity. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eir sources of authority are no longer in Christian revelation, but elsewhere. Hence, beyond agreement about historical views of the scripture and of Christianity, they are unable to agree upon or even present a statement of faith in Christ.

<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
Childs, 99<span class="No-Break">–1</span>07, gives an excellent analysis of the weakness caused to Christian biblical studies by a failure to accept the authority of the canon as well as a very helpful exposition of the role of an authoritative scripture.
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
At root, the issue is one of which authority people will accept for their lives. Occasionally this issue comes to clarity of expression among some who do not accept scripture as having authority. Baum, in “<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Bible as Norm,” expresses his own personal choice this way: “I prefer to think that man may not submit to an authority outside of himself: the ground on which he builds his life must be within him. He must stand on his own feet” (49).

He observes that there are others, such as love of neighbor, but avers that they can all be “narrowed back down to” the one unifying strand. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e book is valuable as the most complete study of the area available. His methodology, however, makes his view of the unity in the New Testament too narrow. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e principles he uses that are most relevant to our subject are a tendency to assume diversity and expect unity to be proved, a tendency to assert diversity on the basis of difference in formulation when the realities being asserted could be identical, a tendency to neglect the unity that is not distinctive of Christianity in relationship to other groups, especially Judaism, and a failure to consider fully the stream of ethical teaching in the New Testament which provides some other strands of unity which are less tractable to his form of gospel reductionism. Finally, and most significantly, his methodology does not allow for combining the New Testament teaching into a synthesis, where all the elements of the synthesis are not presented by all the authors of the New Testament (an approach that someone who looks on the New Testament as a whole as a teaching authority would instinctively adopt). <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere is much diversity in the New Testament, but the New Testament approach to roles of men and women contains some important areas of uniformity.

</p>
<ol>
<li class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-L-O-Num-L1-1st">
<!--<span class="Endnote-List-Counter-Float">1.</span>-->
<span class="Italic">Does submitting to scriptural teaching in the area of men-women roles mean that Christian women have to wear headcoverings in worship?</span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e answer depends on giving an answer to yet another question: Is the headcovering itself the point of the passage, or is it more likely some kind of external expression of men-women order? To put it another way, when Paul laid down the rule about headcoverings, was he mainly concerned with headcoverings as the only proper expression of men-women roles, or was he primarily concerned about men-women roles and order being properly expressed and would he accept a different expression that was culturally the proper one in that society? <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e question itself is difficult, as the discussion in Chapter Seven showed, but insofar as the question of submission to scripture is concerned, it would be easier to believe that somebody’s concern was the intent of the passage if that person was working to find an expression that was suitable to our culture than if that person was simply content to leave the whole passage aside claiming uncertainty. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is point is posed well in R. C. Sproul, “Controversy at Culture Gap,” <span class="Italic">Eternity</span> 27 (May 1976): 13<span class="No-Break">–1</span>5, 40.

<li class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-L-O-Num-L1-SA">
<!--<span class="Endnote-List-Counter-Float">2.</span>-->
<span class="Italic">How does a Christian submit to the Old Testament?</span> It is not enough to say that we are no longer obligated to follow the Old Testament. Jesus approached the Old Testament as his authority, as did Paul and every other New Testament author, as well as the early Fathers. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Old Testament is likewise inspired, canonical teaching that is God’s message to us. However, a Christian cannot approach the Old Testament the same way a Jew would, either now or in the time just before the birth of Jesus. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere is a Christian interpretation of the Old Testament that allows us to know which things were for a stage of God’s dealing with man and which things are for the times after the coming of the Messiah. For example, divorce was given according to the law of Moses for hardness of heart, but a Christian would not approach divorce the same way a Jew following the law of Moses would, because followers of the Messiah would approach it according to what was established by God from the beginning (see Mt 19:3<span class="No-Break">–9</span>).

However, such a view misses the thrust of the anti-Modernist movement. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Fundamentalists have not been strong on tradition, not even their own. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eir reaction was more on the basis that the Modernists were jettisoning Christian realities that were essential to a living Christian faith. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eir commitment was more to the content of the fundamentals than to their own tradition. Barr’s recent book <span class="Italic">Fundamentalism</span> (London: SCM Press, 1977) takes up the discussion in a different and more developed way. He focuses, however, more on the approach of current Fundamentalists (and Evangelicals) to scripture interpretation. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e issue of the origin of Fundamentalism in a response to Modernism-Liberalism, however, is not focused on in the book, perhaps as C. F. H.

Barr’s emphasis on the doctrine of inerrancy in analyzing Fundamentalism is perceptive and helpful, but the doctrine of inerrancy was more part of the intellectual underpinning of an attempt to defend what was seen as the essentials of the Christian faith.

Riley’s premillennialism was by no means universal throughout the Fundamentalist movement. Premillennialists draw upon certain New Testament passages (especially Rv 20:4<span class="No-Break">–6</span>) to support the historicity of Christ’s thousand-year reign with certain martyrs as an interregnum at the end of time. Premillennialists understand Christ’s return to precede this reign, while postmillenarianists argue that his coming follows upon the millennium.

<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e importance of millennialism for Fundamentalists is sometimes overstressed.

<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e search for a “canon within the canon” is part of the attempt to discover what is genuine revelation within the scripture and what is not. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e “quest for the historical Jesus” is likewise a part of this attempt but, although more widely known, is only tangentially relevant to the issues in this book. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e search for a “canon within the canon” is related to some traditional theological approaches which in fact and often in theory work with views of scripture which see parts of the scriptural material as more central than others. Luther’s approach to justification by faith would be a particularly influential example here. Some of the moderate approaches to “the canon within the canon,” like that of Dunn in <span class="Italic">Unity</span>, 374<span class="No-Break">–3</span>76, seem close to such traditional approaches insofar as the accent is on certain parts of scripture having greater weight or centrality. Käsemann, on the other hand, in “Begründet der neutestamentliche Kanon die Einheit der Kirche?” in <span class="Italic">Das Neue Testament als Kanon</span>, ed. Ernst Käsemann (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, 1970), makes very explicit that the concern is to find a canon which is authoritative within the New Testament because, in his view, the various strands within the New Testament are too much at odds with one another to be a unified canon. Nonetheless, a gulf divides approaches like Dunn’s from the traditional discussions because of the failure to accept the whole New Testament as authoritative and inspired. Barr’s approach in <span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Bible in the Modern World</span> (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1970), 159<span class="No-Break">–1</span>61, is only superficially closer, because of his inability to find a successful place for the inspiration of the whole canon. Brevard Childs in <span class="Italic">Biblical <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eology in Crisis</span> analyzes the shortcomings of these approaches very well (see esp. 102).

In bringing together the results of modern philosophical reflection and Lutheran Christianity, he was able to convince many Christian thinkers that the traditional distinctions between the human and the divine, secular history and salvation history, etc., were no longer tenable. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is was foundational for contemporary theological reflection.

Where Christianity saw itself as different from secular philosophy, Hegel understood this dialectical opposition as finally overcome in the <span class="Italic">aufgehoben</span>. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e result is a secular philosophy called “Christianity.” Kierkegaard correctly assesses the effect of this maneuver in the following journal entry:

In general it is characteristic of an age of reason not to let the task remain intact and say: No—but to alter the task and then say: Yes, of course, we are agreed.

</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Block-Quote-Single">
We have assumed that because it is convenient for a mother to care for her child, this is a trait with which women have been more generously endowed by a carefully teleological process of evolution. We have assumed that because men have hunted, an activity requiring enterprise, bravery, and initiative, they have been endowed with these useful attitudes as part of their sex temperament. . . . If a society insists that warfare is the major occupation for the male sex, it is therefore insisting that all male children display bravery and pugnacity . . . (286)
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Block-Quote-Single">
If those temperamental attitudes which we have traditionally regarded as feminine—such as passivity, responsiveness, and a willingness to cherish children—can so easily be set up as the masculine pattern in one tribe, and in another be outlawed for the majority of women as well as for the majority of men, we no longer have any basis for regarding such aspects of behavior as sex-linked. (279<span class="No-Break">–2</span>80)
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next-NI">
Mead takes a different stance regarding nurturance and aggression in <span class="Italic">Male and Female</span>:
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Block-Quote-Single">
It is probable, however, that the young male has a biologically given need to prove himself as a physical individual, and that in the past the hunt and warfare have provided the most common means of such validation. . . . At this point in history, young males are in a particularly difficult spot, threatened with a worldwide catastrophe which no individual heroism can prevent and without new means to exercise their biologically given aggressive protectiveness or desire for individual bravery. (31)
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Block-Quote-Single">
Women may be said to be mothers unless they are taught to deny their child-bearing qualities. Society must distort their sense of themselves, pervert their inherent growth-patterns, and perpetrate a series of learning-outrages upon them, before they will cease to want to provide, at least for a few years, for the child they have already nourished for nine months within the safe circle of their own bodies. (197)
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next-NI">
Mead thus evaluates the data on nurturance and aggression differently in these two books. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese two areas of difference represent a wider difference in tone and approach between <span class="Italic">Sex and Temperament</span> and <span class="Italic">Male and Female</span>.
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
On several occasions, Mead has publicly claimed that these two volumes are not contradictory. She has done so mainly by asserting that <span class="Italic">Sex and Temperament</span> was widely misunderstood. She never intended to attack the existence of biological differences between men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is is the burden of the following quotes:
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Block-Quote-Single">
Nowhere do I suggest that I have found any material which disproves the existence of sex differences. . . . <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is study was not concerned with whether there are or are not actual and universal differences between the sexes, either quantitative or qualitative. (Goldberg, 44)
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Block-Quote-Single">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is is my most misunderstood book. . . . I have been accused of having believed when I wrote <span class="Italic">Sex and Temperament</span> that there are no sex differences . . . (Preface to the 1950 edition of <span class="Italic">Sex and Temperament</span>)
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ough Mead’s intentions in these two books may not have been strictly contradictory it is clear that the books were written in such a way as to readily invite such criticism. (For further comments from Mead, see <span class="Italic">Blackberry Winter</span>, 221<span class="No-Break">–2</span>22.) Nonetheless, we can at least take <span class="Italic">Male and Female</span> as the book which Mead in her mature judgment would see as most accurately reflecting her views on sex differences.
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
Further, Mead did not even think of <span class="Italic">Sex and Temperament</span> as being primarily concerned with the differences between men and women. <span class="Italic">Male and Female</span>, however, is about sex differences:
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Block-Quote-Single">
I went into the field, in 1931, to study one problem, the “conditioning of the social personalities of the two sexes.” I hoped that such an investigation would throw light on sex difference. I found, after two years’ work, that the material which I had gathered threw more light on temperamental differences, i.e., differences among innate individual endowments, irrespective of sex. . . . But when this book came out and often since, oftenest perhaps since I published <span class="Italic">Male and Female</span> (in which I did discuss sex differences), I have been accused of having believed when I wrote <span class="Italic">Sex and Temperament</span> that there are no sex differences . . . (Preface to the 1950 edition of <span class="Italic">Sex and Temperament</span>)
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>erefore, according to Mead’s own testimony regarding her intentions, we are justified in assigning special prominence to <span class="Italic">Male and Female</span> in the context of the present chapter which is discussing the evidence concerning the differences between men and women.

Erikson observed children setting up human scenes with toys and found that boys preferred to set up outdoor scenes with much action, whereas girls preferred indoor scenes with toy characters in more stationary positions.

In an article entitled “Sex and Power in the Balkans” (in Rosaldo/​Lamphere), Bette S. Denich discusses these two sets of economic activities and their impact on men’s and women’s roles:
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Block-Quote-Single">
Worldwide cross-cultural correlations demonstrate that the nature of basic subsistence activity and the sexual division of labor act together in demarcating strategic advantages for local group formation, tending to favor those forms that keep together the sex responsible for the most crucial tasks. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>us, nearly all matrilocal, matrilineal societies are found among horticulturists, where women are gardeners, and it is advantageous to maintain groups of kinswomen as the basic work force. In contrast, both pastoralism and agriculture assign the primary herding and plowing tasks to men. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e predominance of patrilocal residence among surviving pastoral and agricultural societies attests to the ecological adaptiveness of arrangements that keep together male kinsmen, maintaining continuity in their attachment to workmates and property.

In fact, the social structural differences which Maccoby and Jacklin observe may be more significant and full of implications than those differences which they initially critique, though the authors seem genuinely unaware of the potential importance of their new interpretations. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is procedure is carried out when studying compliance (265<span class="No-Break">–2</span>68), dominance (254<span class="No-Break">–2</span>62), affiliation (207<span class="No-Break">–2</span>11, 225<span class="No-Break">–2</span>26), activity rates (176<span class="No-Break">–1</span>77), achievement orientation (135<span class="No-Break">–1</span>38), and task and person orientation (146<span class="No-Break">–1</span>47). <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ough Maccoby and Jacklin’s volume is generally an excellent piece of scholarship, in this area their feminist viewpoint may influence their manner of presentation so that they either fail to see the implications of their evidence, or else fail to communicate them, explicitly and clearly.

Order, efficiency, regimentation, and mass numbers were becoming important values in the military sectors of society. One popular history which alludes to these new values is E. J. Hughes, <span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Church and Liberal Society</span> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1944). <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e ideal of the conjugal family had begun to spread among a broad cross-section of the bourgeoisie (tracing the development and varied manifestations of this ideal is one of the central purposes of Philippe Ariès, <span class="Italic">Centuries of Childhood</span> [London: Jonathan Cape, 1962]). Also, an ideal of individualism became current. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is ideal focused on the individual man (not the individual woman or child) and on his freedom to act independent of the restrictions of others (a concise but clear description of the development of this ideal is found in Lionel Trilling, <span class="Italic">Sincerity and Authenticity</span> [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1971]). In addition, the emergence of the Western nation-state foreshadowed and contributed to the development of technological society. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e nation-state was closely associated with bureaucratic government, an organized military corps, and rapid economic expansion. Crane Brinton is one among many historians who have noted this association, see <span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Shaping of Modern <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ought</span> (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1950), esp. 45<span class="No-Break">–4</span>9, 144<span class="No-Break">–1</span>48. Some of the basic features of technological society were thus already emerging in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Western Europe. For two further helpful discussions of these types of issues, see Marc Bloch, <span class="Italic">Feudal Society</span> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961), 137<span class="No-Break">–1</span>42; and Goode, 23<span class="No-Break">–3</span>3, 370.

Whereas “technique” can refer to all ordered goal-directed behavior, the “functional principle” applies specifically to a task-efficiency orientation. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is narrower term allows for discussion of “relationship value” as found among relational groupings without confusing this quality with the “task efficiency” concern found in functional groupings.

<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e gradual erosion of authoritarianism and the authoritarian family, which went on throughout the liberal phase of bourgeois society, has had an unexpected outcome: the reestablishment of political despotism in a form based not on the family but on its dissolution.

For examples of traditional approaches, see E. W. Burgess, H. J. Locke and M. M. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>omas, <span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Family</span> (New York: American Book Company, 1963), 18<span class="No-Break">–2</span>0; Talcott Parsons and Robert F. Bales, <span class="Italic">Family, Socialization and Interaction Process</span> (Glencoe: Free Press, 1955), 10<span class="No-Break">–1</span>4; Paul E. Mott, <span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Organization of Society</span> (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1965), 163; and Clifford Kirkpatrick, <span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Family as Process and Institution</span> (New York: <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Ronald Press, 1955), 137. However, two new sources of data have recently called this observation into question. First, historical demographers have documented the relative absence of the extended family as a residential unit in the middle ages. Similar investigations of other cultures have shown the extended family residence to be a less frequent arrangement than was once thought. Secondly, certain sociological studies purport to demonstrate the enduring strength of extended kin ties in industrial societies. Upon further examination, each of these objections is seen to carry little weight. (1) Even given that the historical demographers have compiled accurate statistics, the new data need not call for a serious readjustment in the picture of the traditional extended family. Residential data is not the major index of level of commitment, support, resource sharing, and common life. All other evidence points to much higher levels in each of these areas for the traditional extended family relative to its technological counterpart. Some misleading images of traditional family life may be dismissed by the new demographic data, but the general assertion of greater kinship solidarity in traditional society vis-à-vis technological society remains valid. In addition, one should consider Goode’s helpful distinction between ideal and actual family models (see <span class="Italic">World Revolution</span>, 7<span class="No-Break">–1</span>0). In most traditional societies the extended kinship grouping is seen as the ideal residential unit, though lack of economic resources often prevents the majority from living in such a fashion. In modern technological society, on the other hand, the conjugal family of husband, wife, and children is the ideal residential unit, and even the wealthy usually maintain this pattern. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ough the predominant residential unit in both types of societies may be the conjugal family, the existence of varying residential ideals has an impact on the quality of the extended kinship relationships. (2) <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e modern sociological studies on kinship networks in industrial societies also fail to seriously alter the picture of the relative isolation of the nuclear family in technological society. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese studies tend to highlight the friendship relationships that sometimes exist among extended family members, and the continued prominence of family social gatherings of various sorts. A more important focus would be on questions of commitment, stability, resource sharing, and corporate identity. Also, these studies gain much of their effect from contrast with the supposedly nonexistent kinship relationships of technological society. Given that some form of extended kinship relationships still remains in modern technological society, one does not gain an accurate historical perspective unless the modern form is compared with the traditional form. Such a comparison once again supports the assertion that kinship ties tend to be severely weakened in technological society. For two helpful discussions of these recent questions, see Lasch, “<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Family and History,” 34<span class="No-Break">–3</span>6; and Goode, <span class="Italic">World Revolution</span>, 70<span class="No-Break">–7</span>6.

Ryder, “<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Family in Developed Countries,” <span class="Italic">Scientific American</span>, September 1974, 123; C. Christian Beels, “Whatever Happened to Father?” <span class="Italic">New York Times Magazine</span>, August 25, 1974, 11, 52; and Nimkoff, 27<span class="No-Break">–3</span>1, 362<span class="No-Break">–3</span>65. Some sociologists take exception to this formulation, insisting that while some functions have been lost, others have been added or increased in importance. Such items as leisure functions, family planning functions, and “therapeutic” functions are offered as the additional roles brought to family life by technological society. For example, see F. Ivan Nye and Felix M. Bernardo, <span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Family: Its Structure and Interaction</span> (New York: Macmillan, 1973), 247<span class="No-Break">–2</span>48; and Nimkoff, 365<span class="No-Break">–3</span>69. However, the significance of these added functions is questionable. A leisure function and a therapeutic function were also elements of the traditional family. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ough leisure activities are corporately pursued by some modern families, in many other families these activities are the specialized realm of the peer groups of the various family members. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is is increasingly the case as children in a family reach older ages. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ough some modern families engage in family planning, it is still comparatively rare, and it is not clear that this added function contributes markedly to the commitment or solidarity of the family grouping. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e “therapeutic” function of the modern family is certainly increased in importance by the pressures and demands of technological society, but it is of dubious value as a support for family life. Rather than constituting a helpful new family function, the heightened demand for emotional release, healing, and fulfillment within the conjugal family threatens to further weaken the family unit, for in most cases the family relationships are not capable of meeting the demand. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>erefore, it seems clear that the functions lost by the family in technological society are far more significant than those gained, if in fact it is reasonable to say that any positive functions are gained.

<a id="_idTextAnchor1904"></a><a href="27-ch19-The-New-Intellectual-Environment-Ideology-and-Christianity.html#_idTextAnchor1012" class="Endnote-Number-Float">1.</a> Some of the meanings assigned to the term “ideology” are general while others are more specified and technical. Four of the more common meanings, ordered according to increasing levels of specificity, are as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-L-O-Num-L1-1st">
<!--<span class="Endnote-List-Counter-Float">1.</span>-->
In common usage, “ideology” can refer to any system of ideas, especially ideas related to some aspect of human life. According to this definition, psychoanalysis can be called an ideology, as can also Transcendental Meditation.
</li>
<li class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-L-O-Num-L1">
<!--<span class="Endnote-List-Counter-Float">2.</span>-->
In a political context, the term is frequently used as a way of describing theoretical systems which include definite sociopolitical programs and implications. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is is the way that the term is often used by Communists (for one example, see V. I. Lenin in Carl Cohen, <span class="Italic">Communism, Fascism, and Democracy</span> [New York: Random House, 1962], 212). Social scientists also sometimes use the term in this way (for an example, see Berger et al., 159).
</li>
<li class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-L-O-Num-L1">
<!--<span class="Endnote-List-Counter-Float">3.</span>-->
Sociologists often use “ideology” to refer to the sum of the fundamental beliefs, values, theories, and assumptions held by a social group. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is definition allows the sociologist to focus upon the way individuals have their ideas and values conditioned by their social environment. One could thus speak of the Christian ideology of medieval Western Europe or the Islamic ideology of the Ottoman Empire.
</li>
<li class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-L-O-Num-L1-SA">
<!--<span class="Endnote-List-Counter-Float">4.</span>-->
A fourth usage of “ideology” is in fact merely an elaboration of the third usage cited above. Some sociologists further refine the term by applying it only to bodies of thought and belief that justify an existing social system. Any popularly held set of beliefs, values, theories, and assumptions which does not buttress the existing social system is called by another term. In a classic sociological study, Karl Mannheim calls revolutionary systems of thought and belief “utopias” (Mannheim applies this new term to movements such as the sixteenth-century Anabaptists), see Mannheim, <span class="Italic">Ideology and Utopia</span> (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1936), 55<span class="No-Break">–8</span>4.
</li>
</ol>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e definition of “ideology” used in the present volume is primarily definition 2. However, the particular form of definition in the text places a focus upon ideology as a force conditioning the popular opinions and values of individuals within society and in this sense approximates some aspects of 3. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e definition in the text is used because the primary concern in the chapter is with modern systems of thought which have affected the fundamental beliefs of modern social groupings, especially in their vision of how society should be structured.

He does not use them to deny the applicability of the scriptural teaching on the roles of men and women but to raise the question of applicability. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e section on “Some Background Problems” sets forth his view in a helpful way. It is developed in his article on biblical theology (“Biblical <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eology, Contemporary,” <span class="Italic">IDB</span>, 1:418<span class="No-Break">–4</span>32) in a broader way and most helpfully in <span class="Italic">Paul among Jews and Gentiles</span>, where he treats the question of the application of Pauline teaching on justification by faith. His first essay in <span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Bible and the Role of Women</span> is significantly different from the second, which is the one which actually determines his stand on the question of ordination. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e crux of his case is an interpretation of Galatians 3:28 that has already been discussed in Chapter Six, not his principle of application, although the latter plays some role in his view. However, the phrase “the gap between the centuries” has become a popular term somewhat independently of Stendahl, and all the uses of the term should not be attributed to him. (For example, S. Brown and R. Corney, 39<span class="No-Break">–5</span>6, use the phrase “the gap between the centuries” to summarize a constellation of approaches which say that modern men should not apply various elements of scripture at all, rather than to refer to a reality which raises the question of the intent of scripture, as Stendahl does.)

Invoking the logical principle that if an argument is to be valid then the subject of the argument must remain the same throughout, he maintains that the logical subject of the teaching under consideration, namely, woman, has changed so much in the past two thousand years that the texts are not referring to the same subject matter. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>us, what could be applied to women in the first century cannot be applied to what are called “women” in the twentieth century, since they are not the same thing. In raising this issue van der Meer draws an analogy with the usury question. Money has changed so much that the old arguments against usury can no longer be applied to the modern form of capitalism. “Money” and “lending” are simply not the same thing any more. It is certainly worth asking the question whether the intent of the scriptural teaching is men and women as such, or men and women as found in the cultural conditions of the first century. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>at question has been raised in Chapters Nine and Eleven of this book. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e answer to that question is that the intent of scripture is men and women as such as God created them “in the beginning.” It is more ingenious than helpful to raise the question of the same “logical subject.” No first-century person transported to the twentieth century would have any doubt as to which human beings would properly be referred to as “men” and which as “women.” Sex is not so culturally dependent that a change in culture involves an essential change.

However, it is common in contemporary scripture scholarship to use “interpretation” to refer to the entire process of applying scripture, or even more broadly, to the entire process of making the teaching of scripture clear (a process which includes translation and exegesis as well as application). Here, it is used in a more specialized sense, as one possible element of application. “Adaptation,” too, can be understood in more than one way. Even after the elements of a passage are “interpreted” into their contemporary equivalent, they can be followed somewhat differently than the passage specifically instructs, shifting the way the teaching is carried out so as to accomplish the actual intention more faithfully. In this chapter, this shifting process is called “adaptation.” Some people, however, would tend to use the term more broadly, referring not only to changes in the way the passage is followed, but also to changes which we might make in our circumstances (creating a “space” for the teaching to be applied).

</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Block-Quote-Single">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e feminized male is not necessarily a sissy; some are, most are not, though many lean in that direction. Nor is the feminized male a homosexual; some are, most are not. So far as we know, no evidence shows that the two are synonymous, or even closely related. Sex habits may be one thing, and personality quite another. (16)
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next-NI">
By “sissy” Sexton may mean “effeminate” as the term is used in this chapter. If so, Sexton discusses the same three terms distinguished in this chapter.
</p>
<p class="ENDNOTES_Endnote-Next">
It is helpful to notice that the connection between effeminacy and homosexuality in males seems to be closer than that between homosexuality and feminization in males.

One of his main themes is the important role of sentiment in the modern family. He defines romantic love using such terms as “empathy” and “spontaneity,” thus highlighting the aspect of companionship (15<span class="No-Break">–1</span>7). Shorter’s discussion of courtship customs (138<span class="No-Break">–1</span>67) and the nuclear family (205<span class="No-Break">–2</span>54) are also useful for gaining an understanding of the modern ideal of man-woman companionship. Among many Christian feminists, the “companionship marriage” ideal is often praised, and such features as “role-interchangeability” and the abolition of complementarity in marriage are heavily espoused. For a typical example, see Scanzoni/​Hardesty, 106<span class="No-Break">–1</span>18.

Walter W. Kenyon appeared for ordination and stated in the course of the examination that he would not ordain women to the session. He would not oppose the ordination of women, and would even call in someone else to do it, but he would not do so himself. His position was based upon scripture, primarily <span class="Lining-Nums">1 </span>Timothy 2:12. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>at position was not argued either in the original examination before his presbytery (which agreed to ordain him), or in the trial before the synod (which overruled the presbytery) or before the general assembly (which sustained the synod). <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e grounds given for rejecting Kenyon’s ordination was his refusal to abide by the order of the United Presbyterian Church. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>at decision has a great deal of wisdom behind it. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e fundamental issue in such a case is not what the scripture says, but what kind of a body a particular church is and what principles it follows.

Presbytery of Pittsburgh (Remedial Case 1), in the minutes of the General Assembly of the United Presbyterian Church in the USA, 1975, 254<span class="No-Break">–2</span>59.
