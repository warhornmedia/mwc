<p class="BODY-STYLES_Chapter-Opening">
<a id="_idIndexMarker801"></a><span class="Drop-Cap">E</span><span class="Opening-Drop-Words">very known society</span> acknowledges differences between men and women in its traditions and social structure. Many of these differences, such as muscular strength, vocal pitch, sexual function, and anatomy, are plainly visible to all peoples. However, most societies also place much weight on other types of differences between men and women—differences in personality, social relating, and aptitude. If differences such as these exist between men and women, as most societies assume, then the belief that men’s and women’s roles should not be structured in an identical fashion receives important support. For this reason, debate over the existence, extent, and significance of the differences between men and women has been a prominent feature of the current controversy concerning men’s and women’s roles.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is chapter and the one following will consider the data provided by modern science about the differences between men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is chapter will focus on individual characteristics—those studies which view men and women as individuals and which search for the differences between them. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e next chapter will examine social structural characteristics—those studies of the patterns which emerge in social groupings. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is chapter will rely primarily on the findings of modern psychology and the second chapter will rely primarily on anthropology, though each chapter will at times draw data from both disciplines.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese chapters have two concerns. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e first is to determine whether weighty scientific evidence points to the existence of significant cross-cultural differences between men and women, and whether these differences correspond in any way to the pattern of men’s and women’s roles outlined in the scripture. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e second concern is to determine whether weighty scientific evidence indicates that the major differences between men and women might originate from sources other than socialization and cultural conditioning. Another way of phrasing this question is this: Does scientific data support the contention in this book that the purpose of God for men and women, as revealed in scripture, may have been “created into” the human race?
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is second concern must be understood properly, because the way scientific questions are phrased is crucial in forming the answers received. Modern social science constantly confronts a basic issue: To what degree is human behavior determined by biological factors, and to what degree by environmental factors such as socialization and cultural conditioning?<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-133-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-133">*</a></span></span> Some writers who study the differences between men and women organize their inquiry around the question: Do biological differences between men and women <span class="Italic">compel</span> a certain approach to social roles? <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e answer, of course, is “no.” Biological differences do not <span class="Italic">compel</span> any approach to the roles of men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e only constraint imposed by biology is the necessity of distinctly different roles for men and women in sexual intercourse, an act that must be performed to produce children and thus preserve the species. However, this form of the question—do biological differences <span class="Italic">compel</span> social differences—eliminates the need to investigate the differences between men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e question can be answered easily because little of human behavior is actually compelled by biological factors. Human beings can ignore or overcome many apparent determinants of their behavior. A human being is not even compelled to eat—unless, of course, he chooses to survive.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere is a much more helpful way of phrasing the question: Does scientific data point to any biologically influenced characteristics in the human species that fit a pattern of role differences between men and women? Behind this way of phrasing the question is a presupposition. If some differences between men and women appear to exist apart from the influence of socialization and cultural conditioning, and if these differences appear consistent with a pattern of role differences, then human beings would be wise to pattern human society so that these differences are used constructively rather than repressed and stifled. Of course, men and women could decide to pattern human societies in a way that took little account of the human biological makeup. But we could also decide to take the characteristics of the race into account and build with them rather than against them. To use an analogy, the nature of a building material (steel, concrete, wood, or brick) will influence the way a competent architect designs a building—without determining everything about the building’s design. In the same way, the characteristics of the human species should influence the shaping of its social patterns. If human beings adopt this principle of “working with the grain,” then the differences between men and women point toward a way of structuring men’s and women’s roles. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>erefore, the underlying question about biological factors should be framed in a particular way: Is there significant evidence for differences between men and women that do not stem primarily from socialization and cultural conditioning? Might these differences also have some practical consequences for patterning human social roles?
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
To be sure, the characteristics of the human species are only one of several factors which will influence every intelligent approach to structuring society. Human beings should also take into account the economic, political, and social conditions of the contemporary world. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey must understand their current circumstances before formulating an adequate design for the future. Men and women should also pattern their social life according to some vision of the ideal human society. Such visions are usually based on a particular set of ethical principles. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese last two factors—social conditions and ethical vision—will be considered in later chapters of this book. Here they are mentioned as part of the context for examining the psychological and anthropological evidence. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e characteristics of the human material are important for society. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey do not compel human beings to form a society in a particular way, but they are factors which humans must recognize and take into account.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Solid evidence shows that men and women do differ in social relating, aptitude, and personality. Much of the evidence also indicates that these differences are not simply a matter of socialization or cultural conditioning. First, modern psychology has established the existence of many differences between men and women and it promises to establish more in the future. Moreover, these are differences of the type one would expect if men and women were adapted for some differences in functions. Secondly, modern anthropology points to a cultural universal in the area of men’s and women’s role differences. Within the bewildering variety of forms of cultural expression in human history, anthropologists can discern some important, fundamental similarities of pattern. In short, the psychological and anthropological data force us to realize that human beings have remained the same over the last two thousand years in some fundamental ways. Modern circumstances may differ substantially from the circumstances in Paul’s time, but the human material is the same.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Two chapters in a book like this can only briefly review the main features of the evidence for the differences between men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e data will be drawn mainly from the fields of psychology and anthropology. Some supportive ethological data will also be reviewed. Data that is more sociological in nature will be presented in later chapters. Taken together, the material in these two chapters help in understanding the differences between men and women, as well as the factors that must be confronted in forming a healthy human society.

<h2>Understanding Men’s and Women’s Differences</h2>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Subhead-Opening-SA">
<span class="MaWiC_Subhead-Drop-Words">Most</span> people have a common-sense notion of differences in personality, social relating, and aptitude between men and women. In recent years many people have come to believe that most of these differences are caused directly by socialization or cultural conditioning. Nonetheless, most people feel that men and women differ, and they act on this knowledge in their personal relationships. Ideas like the following are part of most people’s common-sense view of men and women:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="BODY-STYLES_L-O-Bull-L1">
<!--<span class="Body-List-Counter-Float">▸</span>-->
Women are more affectionate, “warm,” and personal.
</li>
<li class="BODY-STYLES_L-O-Bull-L1">
<!--<span class="Body-List-Counter-Float">▸</span>-->
Women are more emotional.
</li>
<li class="BODY-STYLES_L-O-Bull-L1">
<!--<span class="Body-List-Counter-Float">▸</span>-->
Women are more interested in children.
</li>
<li class="BODY-STYLES_L-O-Bull-L1">
<!--<span class="Body-List-Counter-Float">▸</span>-->
Men get along together better than women do.
</li>
<li class="BODY-STYLES_L-O-Bull-L1">
<!--<span class="Body-List-Counter-Float">▸</span>-->
Men find it harder to control their sex drive.
</li>
<li class="BODY-STYLES_L-O-Bull-L1-SA">
<!--<span class="Body-List-Counter-Float">▸</span>-->
Men are “tougher.”
</li>
</ul>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese statements are rooted in the simple perception of some important differences between men and women. However, such unqualified statements are also imprecise, and at times contribute to the formation of damaging stereotypes—the “Humphrey Bogart man,” the “Victorian woman”<a id="_idTextAnchor665"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1649">1</a></span>—or are used as a way to disparage others. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>us considering these common-sense notions uncovers an important issue which must be dealt with before proceeding to the actual scientific data. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e issue is how to accurately conceptualize and describe the differences between men and women.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-SA">
One can think about the differences between men and women with a minimum of distortion if the following principles are observed:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="BODY-STYLES_L-O-Num-L1-1st">
<!--<span class="Body-List-Counter-Float">1.</span>-->
<span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e differences between men and women should be stated descriptively rather than evaluatively.</span> Too often, such statements are made to evaluate. For example, a group of men will talk about women’s emotions or their lack of self-control in speech; a group of women will discuss men’s irresponsibility or lack of sensitivity in sexual relations. Many statements that appear descriptive are actually evaluative. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e statement “women are more emotional than men” looks as if it were descriptive, but normally it is spoken as an evaluative statement. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e speaker, a man, usually means that women are more prone than men to lose control of their behavior and judgment under the influence of their emotions. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e speaker usually deplores this tendency. Evaluative statements such as these do little to help one understand the differences between the sexes. It is far better to simply describe these differences.
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Para-w-in-List-Item-L1">
Moreover, any comparison of a male trait with a female trait which judges that one is intrinsically better than another is distorted because it presumes an identity of role or function. For example, to deplore women’s “emotionalism” presumes that men and women are both “supposed to” express their emotions in an identical fashion. However, such a judgment is not possible if men and women are supposed to express their emotions differently, or if emotions are supposed to be expressed differently in different situations.
</p>
</li>
<li class="BODY-STYLES_L-O-Num-L1">
<!--<span class="Body-List-Counter-Float">2.</span>-->
<span class="Italic"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e differences between men and women are not absolutes.</span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is principle applies especially to individual personality traits such as aggressiveness, emotional expressiveness, or nurturance. For example, as will be discussed in detail later, evidence indicates that men are more aggressive than women. However, this is a generalization. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e actual results of testing a representative sample of men and women for aggressiveness looks something like an overlapping double bell-shaped curve on a graph (see the illustration below). <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e overall distribution of the curves shows men higher on aggression. Some women would be more aggressive than most of the men, but men appear in greater proportions at increasingly higher levels of aggression.
<div>
<div id="_idContainer022" class="Illustration">
<p><img src="files/images/AggressivenessGraph.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Para-w-in-List-Item-L1">
A statement like “men are more aggressive than women” is a generalization.<a id="_idTextAnchor666"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1650">2</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e bell-shaped curve is the curve of probability. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e larger the sample of men and women being tested, the more accurate the results will be. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e smaller the sample, the more unreliable the results. In other words, conclusions from psychological tests for trait differences are not absolutes. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey are statements of probability.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Para-w-in-List-Item-L1">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is fact is important in any description of the differences between men and women. On the one hand, statements about trait differences tend to become unreliable in small samples—say, a comparison between one man and one woman. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e fact that men tend to be more aggressive than women is less likely to be verified with a small sample than with a large one. On the other hand, the fact that some women are more aggressive than most men would not mean that no such trait difference exists. It does exist. It can be a useful generalization—if employed fairly and expressed properly. In short, statements about men and women in terms of trait differences must be made carefully, but these differences do exist and they are an essential aspect of the psychological makeup of the sexes.
</p>
</li>
<li class="BODY-STYLES_L-O-Num-L1">
<!--<span class="Body-List-Counter-Float">3.</span>-->
<span class="Italic">Both sexes possess every trait.</span> Men and women can be compared on the same tests because they have the same traits. Both men and women are aggressive and both men and women are nurturant. Except for biologically reproductive tasks like childbearing and nursing, there are no activities that both men and women cannot engage in. Both can fight and both can nurse the sick. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e differences between men and women lie in the relative strengths of various traits and the personality structures underlying the individual traits.
</li>
<li class="BODY-STYLES_L-O-Num-L1">
<!--<span class="Body-List-Counter-Float">4.</span>-->
<span class="Italic">Many trait comparisons are not universal but hold only within the same social group or within the context of male-female relationships.</span> For example, men are taller than women, but an unwise cross-cultural comparison could show the opposite: Tutsi women are taller than Pygmy men; thus, women are taller than men. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e point is that most trait differences between men and women hold for members of a particular social group. It is also true that many trait differences tend to appear only within the context of male-female relationships. Men tend to be protective, but they will often act in a protective manner only when their own women and children are present. In other words, the presence of the opposite sex—and often only certain members of the opposite sex—will release or inhibit certain qualities.

<h2>Descriptive Social Science</h2>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Subhead-Opening">
<span class="MaWiC_Subhead-Drop-Words"><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e</span> available data on the individual characteristics of men and women have come from two different methods of scientific investigation. <a id="_idIndexMarker803"></a><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e first, called the descriptive method, uses description and conceptualization as its major tools. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e descriptive method often relies on direct observation in a professional setting such as a classroom, an anthropological field study, or a clinical examination. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e <a id="_idIndexMarker804"></a>second method relies primarily on experimentation and quantitative analysis. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e conclusions drawn from this method are usually more limited than those drawn from the descriptive method, but they derive from tests which are controllable and repeatable.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Both the descriptive and experimental methodologies have yielded data which contributes substantially to an understanding of the differences between men and women. At the same time, both methods of research have their limitations. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e task in this chapter is to assess the contributions of each approach, and to use the strength of each methodology to complement the limitations of the other.<a id="_idTextAnchor670"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1652">4</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
In a sense, the descriptive methodology has a certain priority: description precedes experimentation. An experimental investigator must define, conceptualize, and describe his problem before he can fruitfully apply experimental methods to it. If the phenomenon being studied is described inadequately, the experimental studies of that phenomenon are likely to be inadequate as well.<a id="_idTextAnchor671"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1653">5</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>us experimental investigators rely on descriptive methods—and often on previous descriptive studies—for the success of their work. Descriptive methods are particularly useful for conceptual precision and elaboration, and they can serve experimental investigators well.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
However, descriptive methods are less able than experiments to yield findings which can be decisively substantiated and duplicated. Authors who work with descriptive techniques lack clear agreement on the elements of their scientific method. Agreement on scientific method provides a field of study with a standard that can determine when an observation or a theory is to be accepted as true or valuable. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>erefore, descriptive authors are less apt than experimental scientists to attempt to substantiate, develop, or refine the conclusions of another author or body of authors. No one’s work can be seen as fully authoritative in the field because of the field’s lack of consensus regarding scientific method. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is limitation of descriptive methods is partly responsible for the great variety of viewpoints found in the descriptive literature. Of course, experimental scientists also cluster in a wide variety of distinct schools of thought; still, the descriptive literature probably has an even greater number of competing schools and widely diverging theoretical perspectives. Because the findings of each author and school cannot be substantiated and duplicated according to a set of methods acceptable to all, the descriptive literature is often unable to provide a unified set of findings on a particular topic area.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Descriptive methods are also less able than experimental methods to identify precisely the origins of human behavior. Descriptive authors sometimes claim to be describing phenomena that are basic or essential to human nature—phenomena that could be termed “biological” in origin. However, they do not usually try to state precisely either the mechanisms by which these phenomena develop and are manifested, or the nature of the interaction between biological and environmental factors. Experimental data is more relevant to these concerns. Experimental methods are more able to isolate underlying mechanisms and to help in estimating the relative contribution of biological and environmental factors in forming the different behavior patterns of men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e descriptive literature is not irrelevant on these questions, but it definitely has less to offer than the experimental literature.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is does not mean that experimental studies are to be preferred over descriptive studies. Some social scientists do have a strong preference for experimental studies, viewing experimental data as “hard” and objective in contrast to “soft” and subjective descriptive data.<a id="_idTextAnchor672"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1654">6</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is is an unfair characterization of descriptive social science. As mentioned, experiments depend on precise description. In fact, descriptive methods can be as exact and objective as any scientist would wish. For example, the science of biology rests largely on a foundation of exact description and classification. Descriptive methods in other disciplines have also been highly productive and useful.<a id="_idTextAnchor673"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1655">7</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Moreover, experimental methods have limitations of their own. Experimental investigators are limited to behavior which can be precisely described <span class="Italic">and</span> quantified for study in experimental settings. Quantifying human behavior for experimental study is a formidable methodological challenge, one which experimental psychologists have not entirely surmounted. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e problems in quantifying behavioral differences between men and women are especially great. As a result, experimental studies of men’s and women’s differences are relatively undeveloped. Psychologists have only recently become interested in such studies, and they have not yet accumulated a body of substantial, consistent, and meaningful data.<a id="_idTextAnchor674"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1656">8</a></span> Experimental studies have yielded some highly relevant, important data, but, on the whole, it comprises a very tentative picture of men’s and women’s differences. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>us descriptive as well as experimental studies need to be considered in a review of the literature on men’s and women’s differences.

<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">

<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is descriptive material will focus on the structures of male-female personality which underlie the individual trait differences such as aggression, nurturance, and dependency. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese structural differences are probably more important than individual trait differences. As set forth in descriptive literature, these structures clarify trait differences, and help us understand larger differences in the male and female psychological makeup. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese structures can be called “trait-patterns.” In one sense, a trait-pattern is a trait in itself. However, it is a trait which finds expression not in one isolated and localized set of behaviors, but in a number of diverse characteristics which are all related to one another in a specific structure. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is structure is the trait-pattern. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e two major trait-patterns which emerge from the descriptive literature might be called patterns of integration/​differentiation and goal orientation/​personal need orientation.

<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e first trait-pattern concerns the relative integration or differentiation of individual characteristics in men and women.

. . . the difference in the personality structure of man and woman remains an undeniable reality.

Both Hildebrand and Stein say that men and women differ in the way their minds, emotions, and bodies function together. A woman’s emotions, intellect, and body form a more integrated unity than those of a man. She confronts decisions, activities, and relationships as an entire person—a blend of emotions, intellect, and body. On the other hand, a man’s emotions, intellect, and body are more differentiated. He more easily compartmentalizes elements of his personality, treating them as aspects of his identity which he can at times temporarily ignore.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is integration/​differentiation pattern clarifies the common observation that women think differently, express their emotions differently, and relate to their bodies differently than men. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese differences are sometimes phrased in quantitative terms: Women are more emotional than men, men are more analytical than women, and so forth. However, one important implication of seeing many differences between men and women in terms of the integration/​differentiation trait-pattern difference is that the intellectual and emotional differences between men and women have less to do with the relative strength of intellectual and emotional functions and more to do with the way these functions operate in relation to each other. To understand this difference more fully, we will investigate how it operates in the emotional, mental, and physical life of men and women.

How does this difference originate, and how can it be described? A description of the emotional differences between men and women based on the integration/​differentiation trait-pattern would include these observations: Men have more distance from their emotions, and a greater capacity to detach themselves from immediate reactions, whereas women respond to situations more immediately and spontaneously, and find it harder to distance themselves from the way they feel. Buytendijk notes this difference in a description of an experiment involving men and women reading and responding to a series of cartoons:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e women found the comic effect of cartoons diminished by the entry of any tendentious element. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e more any cartoon served a tendency to make a direct appeal to the emotions, the less they found it to their taste. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey felt too much involved, they sometimes identified themselves with the object being ridiculed, and so could not maintain the “emotional distance” necessary to be able to give the situation an ambiguous and amusing structure . . .<a id="_idTextAnchor680"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1660">12</a></span>

It also makes sense that she is able earlier than boys to concentrate on details immediate in time and space, and has throughout a finer discrimination for things seen, touched, and heard.

Erikson’s observations along with the other material from the descriptive literature show a pattern of emotional differences between men and women which can be summarized this way.

Focused consciousness has emerged over thousands of years from the unconscious, and is still emerging. All our education is an attempt to produce and sharpen it in order to give us power to look at things and analyze them into their component parts, in order to give us the ability to formulate ideas, and the capacity to change, invent, create. . . .

At first we are discouraged because there exists no one definition of the term “intuition.” A recent investigator distinguished at least seven meanings of the term, and it seems that such meanings as “hunch” and “extra-sensory perception” do not come into the issue under discussion. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey are quite heterogeneous to other forms of intuitive knowledge, all of which have one thing in common: knowledge by union, contrary to knowledge by disassembly. . . .

<a id="_idIndexMarker818"></a>Sherry Ortner summarizes this important point about intellectual differences between men and women:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
It is important to specify what we see as the dominant and universal aspects of the feminine psyche. If we postulate emotionality or irrationality, we are confronted with those traditions in various parts of the world in which women functionally are, and are seen as, more practical, pragmatic, and this-worldly than men. One relevant dimension that does seem pan-culturally applicable is that of relative concreteness vs. relative abstractness: the feminine personality tends to be involved with concrete feelings, things, and people, rather than with abstract entities; it tends toward personalism and particularism. A second, closely related, dimension seems to be that of relative subjectivity vs. relative objectivity: Chodorow cites Carlson’s study, which concludes that “males represent experiences of self, others, space, and time in individualistic, objective, and distant ways, while females represent experiences in relatively interpersonal, subjective, immediate ways.”<a id="_idTextAnchor689"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1668">20</a></span>

Ortner sees the differences between the male and female “psyche” in terms of two dimensions: concreteness/abstractness, and subjectivity/objectivity. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is description fits well with the previous quotes describing the distinct male and female intellectual approaches. It also harmonizes well with the overall integration/​differentiation trait-pattern.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e principles discussed earlier are relevant to these descriptive observations about intellectual differences between men and women. First, the literature is not saying that men think more effectively than women. Such a statement assumes that one form of thought (distanced analysis) is more effective than another (empathetic intuition). <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e literature is not mainly positing an ability difference between men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e mental faculties in women are in themselves no less penetrating than those in men. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e literature is describing only a difference in the pattern of cognitive styles. Again, no judgment is made that one pattern is more valuable than the other.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Secondly, though these structural differences may be more important and significant than the trait differences, they are probably not absolute differences.

<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-SA">
<a id="_idIndexMarker823"></a>Buytendijk comments that women are generally more conscious of their bodies:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
However, the body is the first—and the last—situation which every human being comes across in his existence and to which he gives meaning. It is clear that woman takes more notice of her own bodily nature and appearance than man of his, and in this measure she finds it the more difficult to forget her own body, and she becomes proportionately engrossed in the external world. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>erefore, it is necessary for us to give attention to the relation of woman to her own body.<a id="_idTextAnchor691"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1670">22</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI-SA">
Bardwick makes a similar general statement:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
Women experience their body boundaries more definitely than men do and have clearer criteria for conceptualizing their bodies as psychological objects. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eir self-evaluation as women depends largely upon their physical attractiveness and their sexual and maternal behavior. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eir awareness of internal sexual functions is reinforced by the menstrual cycle. Normal femininity includes the acceptance of menstruation, pregnancy, maternity as the normal and desired consequences of being a woman.<a id="_idTextAnchor692"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1671">23</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
It appears, then, that differences between the way men and women experience their bodies is one of the most important differences in the literature. It is also one which is strongly related to the integration/​differentiation trait-pattern observed earlier.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-SA">
Most of the descriptive authors connect woman’s heightened awareness of her body to the fact that her sexuality is more temporally and spatially diffuse, whereas a man’s sexuality is more temporally and spatially specific. Woman’s sexual experience is extended over time in a series of different phases—menstruation, intercourse, conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation. By contrast, a man’s sexual experience is simpler and more psychologically delimited—intercourse and pre-intercourse. In similar fashion, woman’s sexuality is more extended in space—vagina, clitoris, breasts, and a generally more sensitive body. A man’s sexuality is simpler and more localized in space—the phallic region, along with hands and lips. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e sexual body thus comes to woman’s consciousness in many forms and at many times, whereas the man’s sexual body protrudes into his consciousness in a more consistent form and only at certain times. Deutsch asserts these points strongly:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-1st">
In man, somatic satisfaction through the pleasurable discharge of the germ plasm and disposition of this plasm in a safe and fostering body are integral parts of a single act. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e service to the species takes place at the same time as the sexual satisfaction and can subsequently be completely disregarded by him.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Last">
In woman, the goal of her germ plasm, that is to say, her service to the species, is realized only much later, after a certain fixed interval of time. Even the internal processes in the woman’s body are subject to separation in time, for the maturation of the ovum and its fecundation are two temporally separated functions. . . . In woman, psychologic associative bridges lead from coitus to childbirth and vice versa from childbirth to coitus, and the two processes are to a large extent identified.<a id="_idTextAnchor693"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1672">24</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI-SA">
<a id="_idIndexMarker824"></a>Margaret Mead also notes these differences in the way men and women relate to their bodies. She discusses spatial diffusion and spatial specificity in this way:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
In those societies where children’s sex membership is recognized by adults, in which men treat the little girls with flirtatious attention and women tease and challenge the small boys, the little girls respond by movements of the entire body, which undulates, and postures in delicious indulgence of feminine response. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e small boy struts, sometimes with emphasis on his penis, more often carrying hatchet, knife, stick, pole, in upward positions as he marches, parries, performs. His behavior, however symbolic, is to the extent that it is male a concentrated phallic exaggeration, while his sister’s is more diffuse and involves the whole body.<a id="_idTextAnchor694"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1673">25</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI-SA">
At another point, Mead comments upon the issue of temporal sexual diffusion and specificity:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
Male sexuality seems originally focused to no goal beyond immediate discharge. . . . In the female, however, we are confronted with something very different. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e male sex act is immediately self-resolving and self-satisfying, but the female analogue is not the single copulatory experience, however self-resolving that may appear to be, but the whole cycle of pregnancy, birth, and lactation.<a id="_idTextAnchor695"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1674">26</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>us some of the descriptive literature maintains that sexuality is more diffused in time and space for the woman. It is spread throughout her body and her life and is thus more fully a part of her personality, rather than being more of a distinct, localized sense datum specified in space and time, as it is for the man. A man tends to consider sexual activity as another element in his life, something he can more easily detach from himself and compartmentalize.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is differing pattern of men’s and women’s relationships to their bodies may perhaps explain a commonly observed difference between the way men and women enter into and experience sexual relationships.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-130-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-130">*</a></span></span> Men tend to approach a sexual relationship as a pleasurable activity which they pursue regardless of the identity of their partner.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
On the other hand, most women find it more difficult to participate in a sexual relationship without simultaneously developing an emotional attachment to their sexual partner. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e partner’s identity is more important, and physical pleasure in sexual activity is more contingent upon the nature of the personal relationship. Similarly, the type of initial stimulus which will arouse a man sexually is usually physical (sight or touch), whereas the initial stimulus for a woman is often some expression of personal attention. All of these observations fit the integration/​differentiation trait-pattern difference: Men are more able to disengage themselves personally from their sexuality, while women are more personally and emotionally invested in their sexuality.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>us, the integration/​differentiation pattern of personality structure emerges in several areas of difference between men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is pattern is especially important because it does not consist merely of differences in individual capacities and traits. Rather, the integration/​differentiation pattern helps clarify how these capacities and traits are organized within the individual. It fits observed differences in behavior into a pattern that is reasonably consistent, coherent, and highly relevant to the effort to understand the way men and women differ.

<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e second major trait-pattern difference between men and women which emerges from the descriptive literature is a difference between the orientation of men’s and women’s social behavior. Male social behavior is more goal oriented; and female social behavior is oriented more toward helping or caring for personal needs. According to this generalization, men are more purposeful in human situations, more inclined to formulate and pursue long-range goals, more invested in accomplishing a particular set of prescribed ends. On the other hand, women tend to be more concerned with immediate needs and with the way people relate to one another. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is difference in the orientation of behavior appears to be not simply one trait, but a broad, significant, and consistent pattern embracing all types of social behaviors.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-129-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-129">*</a></span></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-SA">
Extensive treatment of the goal/​personal need trait-pattern difference is found in the writings of <a id="_idIndexMarker828"></a>F. J. J. Buytendijk. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e terms he selects to describe these patterns are “work” and “care”:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
. . . the distinction and contrast of the sexes is revealed and can be known in the distinction of two acts: the act of work and the act of care. . . . Comparing and contrasting work and care, we notice that work means an activity that proceeds from an intentional act in which the consciousness is directed toward a proposed goal, this goal being independent with respect to the occupation or activity itself. In this kind of activity, the world is understood as a system of means provided for reaching the proposed goal. Work presupposes that the one who works directs himself toward a particular end, result or goal that itself lies outside of the work as such. . . . <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e world of care is a world of actual values encountered and of possible values educed and called forth by the presence and activity of the person who cares. . . . <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e object of care is above all the human reality, of whatever presents itself as human. . . . Work is masculine in character in that there is an accentuation of pauses in its procedure. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e pauses are points of rest as preliminary goals within the process of work. Care, which is feminine in character, does not manifest a line of procedure. Within the act of care as such there is no directedness toward a goal to be achieved, for the act is intentionally directed toward the object of care as it is, in its own value.<a id="_idTextAnchor699"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1675">27</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI-SA">
Here, Buytendijk stresses that “work” is primarily directed to a pre-set goal, while “care” is directed primarily to values and people.<a id="_idTextAnchor700"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1676">28</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e following comment from Buytendijk amplifies and expands his meaning of “care”:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
In actual fact, the object of care, calling for care, is anything that is encountered, not as a means to an end nor as material to be given a new form, but as something unfulfilled because alone and at the same time unfulfilled because of the possibilities in it that could be brought to realization through the presence, the hand, the eye of someone who cares, even if the encounter is only for a brief moment. It is only through the fact of care that a few little flowers being arranged take on their high aesthetical value, and the same can be said of anything being arranged, placed, lighted, cleaned, etc. so that, “it will appear to advantage,” which means simply that its own value will be appreciated.<a id="_idTextAnchor701"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1677">29</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>us the object of “care” is not a dead material being acted upon, but a living substance whose potentialities are expressed through the agency of the one who cares. Buytendijk’s definition of “care” extends beyond the realm of human needs to include the gift of bringing forth the latent vitality or beauty of any situation. However, his discussion is primarily interested in the human objects of “care.”
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-SA">
<a id="_idIndexMarker829"></a><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e anthropologist Margaret Mead takes a considerably different approach to this subject, but her observations about this trait-pattern difference are highly illuminating. From her anthropological field work, she generalizes about the male orientation toward achievement and the female orientation toward the nurturing of children:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
In every known human society, the male’s need for achievement can be recognized. . . . <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e recurrent problem of civilization is to define the male role satisfactorily enough—whether it be to build gardens or raise cattle, kill game or kill enemies, build bridges or handle bank-shares—so that the male may in the course of his life reach a solid sense of irreversible achievement, of which his childhood knowledge of the satisfactions of childbearing have given him a glimpse. In the case of women, it is only necessary that they be permitted by the given social arrangements to fulfill their biological role, to attain this sense of irreversible achievement. . . . Put very simply, men have to learn as children to want to beget and cherish children, and to maintain a society in which children are provided for as well as simply protected against enemies. Women, on the other hand, have to learn to want children only under socially prescribed conditions. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e small male looks at his body and at the bodies of other males of all ages and realizes his potentialities to explore, to take apart, to put together, to construct the new, to penetrate the mysteries of the world, to fight, to make love. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e small female looks at her body, and at the body of other females of all ages, and realizes her potentialities to make, to hold, to suckle, to care for, a child.<a id="_idTextAnchor702"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1678">30</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
Mead adds two new assertions to our description of the goal orientation/​personal need orientation pattern. First, she describes what we have called “the personal need trait-pattern” exclusively in terms of nurturing children. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ough her presentation may be excessively limited, the idea that maternal care is the embodiment of the “personal need trait-pattern” finds confirmation elsewhere in the descriptive literature. Even Buytendijk, who visualizes “care” as a mode of relating to inanimate objects as well as human beings, devotes an entire chapter to “motherliness,” which he calls “the fulfillment of the activity of care.”<a id="_idTextAnchor703"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1679">31</a></span> Secondly, Mead views the male pattern of achievement-striving as a psychological compensation for the man’s inability to bear children. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is hypothesis will be discussed briefly later in this chapter.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-SA">
<a id="_idIndexMarker830"></a>Edith Stein talks about the personal need trait-pattern in a way similar to Buytendijk. She also links it to the integration/​differentiation trait-pattern:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
A sphere for genuinely feminine work exists wherever sensibility, intuition and adaptability are needed, and where the whole human being needs attention, whether it has to be nursed or educated or helped in any other way, perhaps by understanding it and assisting it to express itself.<a id="_idTextAnchor704"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1680">32</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
Stein emphasizes the attention woman gives to the whole person. Men tend to help by analyzing a situation or a person and thus isolating the particular sphere of need. By contrast, the female mode of care meets the whole person and cares for the whole person. Woman thus brings her more integrated psychological structure to bear upon a situation which she perceives as a living whole.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
We can now begin to see the relationship between the two trait-patterns: goal orientation/​personal need orientation and integration/​differentiation. Women—whose psychological makeup tends to be more of an integrated whole of faculties, abilities, emotions, mind, body—more naturally approach social situations in their totality, in terms of personal care rather than in terms of specific problems. Men—whose psychological makeup tends to be more distanced and differentiated—relate to social situations more in terms of specific aims or problems they are attempting to solve. (Of course, these aims and questions may involve personal care.) Integration/​differentiation describes the internal pattern of the male-female psychological structure; its external reflection is the goal orientation/​personal need orientation pattern—their characteristic modes of approaching social life.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-128-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-128">*</a></span></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Two final remarks about the goal orientation/​personal need orientation trait-pattern will prove helpful. First, trait-patterns do not imply an ability difference. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e writers who assert trait-pattern differences do not claim that men can achieve goals more effectively and that women can care for personal needs better than men. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese ability differences may exist, but that is a separate question. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e primary concern in the descriptive literature is with the characteristic ways that men and women relate to various life situations. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese writers are asking which approaches appear most “natural” and which bring the greatest personal satisfaction. Women may have the capacity to set long-range goals and men may be able to care for the immediate personal needs of others, but the descriptive literature asserts that this is not their characteristic pattern of relating and is not the pattern which most naturally brings them satisfaction. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is trait-pattern difference does not necessarily imply an ability difference.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-127-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-127">*</a></span></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Secondly, this material from the descriptive literature should not be the basis for unfounded evaluations. For example, one could interpret this material as an attack on men for their “indifference” to immediate personal needs. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e literature does not support this interpretation.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-126-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-126">†</a></span></span> In fact, if properly understood and employed, the male goal orientation pattern will shape and strengthen the way men care for others’ needs. A properly balanced goal orientation can actually improve the way a doctor, counselor, minister, or father cares for others’ needs. An important implication of this trait-pattern difference is its complementarity: Women will bring their personal need orientation into the way they set goals; men will bring their goal orientation into the way they care for personal needs.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese two trait-patterns—the integration/​differentiation pattern and the goal orientation/​personal need orientation pattern—do not exhaust all of the relevant observations available in the literature of descriptive social science. However, they provide a summary of the most significant points of convergence in a form which is useful for the purposes of this book.<a id="_idTextAnchor706"></a><a id="_idTextAnchor707"></a>

<h2>Experimental Psychology</h2>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Subhead-Opening">
<span class="Regular">Experimental </span>psychology, the other major approach to psychological investigation, likewise contributes to the study of the differences between men and women. As discussed earlier, experimental methods can yield findings which are decisively substantiated, and can also more surely identify the origins of behavior. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is section will summarize the differences between men and women substantiated in the experimental literature. It will then discuss those efforts in experimental psychology to sort out the various biological and sociological sources of the differences between men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is section will conclude with some general reflections on the experimental data and the current limitations of experimental methods.<a id="_idTextAnchor709"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1682">34</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ough there is some disagreement over specific issues, the experimental data generally indicates the existence of several significant physical, emotional, social, and intellectual differences between men and women. Of course, the word “significant” is a relative term. For example, the differences between men and women would appear relatively insignificant in comparison to the differences between humans and apes. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e differences affirmed by contemporary psychologists would also appear less significant than those asserted by Victorian physicians a hundred years ago.<a id="_idTextAnchor710"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1683">35</a></span> However, the experimentally documented psychological variations between men and women appear significant indeed when compared to the expected range of variation among members of each sex. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e data from experimental psychology supports the view that men and women are not interchangeable units, but are two different types of human being.

However, rough-and-tumble play often appears so similar to malicious fighting that researchers usually view it as a manifestation of aggression.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e results of the many studies of aggression in men and women are strikingly consistent. In nearly all the studies, the male of the human species appears more aggressive than the female.<a id="_idTextAnchor716"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1688">40</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is conclusion is strongly supported by ethological studies of mammalian behavior, particularly primate behavior, and by the common observation that there are more men than women in armies, physically violent sports, and criminal penitentiaries.<a id="_idTextAnchor717"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1689">41</a></span> Cross-cultural experiments on children have demonstrated that boys are more aggressive than girls in both Western and non-Western, developed and developing cultures. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e evidence could hardly be stronger that men are more aggressive than women.

(<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere is no disagreement about many of the physical differences.)
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Men are more aggressive than women according to most psychological tests for this trait, but researchers interpret these results in different ways. As mentioned earlier, psychologists differ in their definitions of aggression. Some define it as simple violent behavior, a desire to cause harm. Others define aggression in terms of frustration. According to this view, male aggressive behavior is motivated by the higher levels of frustration experienced by men. Finally, some researchers define aggression as a broader quality related to ambition, drive, and competitiveness.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese definitions vary according to the psychologist’s judgment about the motives behind male behavior, and the degree to which these motives can then be extended to behavior which is not explicitly violent. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e most restrictive definition of aggression—aggression means a desire to cause physical harm to another—would make it difficult to apply the findings about aggression to many other types of human behavior. It may explain why men are more numerous in armies, prisons, and football teams, but it would not clarify the sources of many other observed behavior differences between men and women. However, many psychologists prefer a broader definition of aggression. Some relate aggression to dominance behavior—the desire to triumph over another, to defeat an opponent, and establish oneself in an ascendant position. If so, then aggression also lies behind general competitiveness in political, economic, and social life, and thus men may have a biologically based advantage in competitive achievement.<a id="_idTextAnchor718"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1690">42</a></span> Experiments to measure competitiveness in men and women have not yet yielded significant data, but there is some indication that this inference from the studies of aggression is justified.<a id="_idTextAnchor719"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1691">43</a></span> Other investigators believe that aggression either motivates or is motivated by frustration.

<a id="_idTextAnchor722"></a>Some of the most significant data derives from the study of mammalian behavior. Humans do not always behave as other mammals do, but any behavior pattern which appears to be nearly universal among mammals must be taken seriously as strong evidence. Nurturant behavior appears to be such a nearly universal pattern. In almost all mammalian species, the female takes primary responsibility for the care of offspring.<a id="_idTextAnchor723"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1693">45</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e nurturant behavior of mammalian males varies widely from species to species, but they rarely respond as intensely to the needs of offspring as do the females.<a id="_idTextAnchor724"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1694">46</a></span> In some species, males will actually respond aggressively to offspring, even to the point of killing and eating a litter. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is ethological data concerning male and female nurturance must be supported by studies of humans in order to receive final confirmation, but such a nearly universal mammalian pattern provides initial support for the common human observation that women are more nurturant than men.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
While many more studies of human nurturance need to be conducted, the data which exists does suggest that women are indeed more nurturant than men. One hormonal study, to be discussed more fully in a later section, indicates that male hormones likely inhibit nurturance.<a id="_idTextAnchor725"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1695">47</a></span> Girls who had been exposed to abnormally large quantities of male hormone while in the fetus stage show less interest in dolls and children and less of a tendency to fantasize expectantly about marriage and family life.

Girls aged seven to eleven gave more emotional support in all six of the cultures studied. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>erefore, though the experimental data is still slim, it points in the direction of a difference between men and women in nurturant behavior.

<a id="_idIndexMarker838"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker839"></a>Emotional Differences
</h3>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
Experiments designed to test the common observation that men and women differ in the way their emotions function have frequently encountered two major obstacles. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e first obstacle arises when an experimenter attempts to define and measure emotional states. Experimental psychologists like to measure behavior, but the link between behavior and emotional states is hard to define. For example, one type of behavior such as aggression can potentially be connected with a number of emotions such as fear, hostility, and frustration. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>us a psychologist studying emotions must usually rely on some form of subjective self-report by his subjects. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is method is not always possible, as in infant studies, nor is it always reliable. A second obstacle is a problem of conceptualization. As noted earlier, the descriptive literature has contributed to the understanding of emotional differences between men and women by looking at larger psychological patterns instead of individual traits. Experimental psychology studies individual traits almost exclusively. It is not yet at the point of development where it is equipped to adequately cope with the complexities involved in testing hypotheses such as the ones suggested by the descriptive literature. Many experimental psychologists recognize this limitation, but it remains a limitation. Nevertheless, the experimental data does reveal two areas of possible emotional difference between men and women: anxiety and frustration.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<a id="_idIndexMarker840"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker841"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker842"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker843"></a>Numerous studies utilizing a self-report method have shown women to be more anxious and fearful than men.<a id="_idTextAnchor727"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1697">49</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese results have been interpreted in two ways: Either men are actually less fearful and anxious than women, or else they are less willing to expose their fears and anxieties to experimental psychologists. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ere is a good chance that both interpretations have a substantial basis. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e results of such tests are strong and consistent: Women <span class="Italic">do</span> report higher levels of anxiety and fearfulness. However, other studies show that men do tend to be more reserved on self-test studies of emotions. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is qualifies the results of such tests, but does not nullify them. Another factor to consider is the likelihood that men and women respond differently to various fear-inducing situations. One psychologist suggests that women might respond with greater fear to physical danger, the dark, and other such threatening situations, whereas men might respond with greater fear to situations which directly challenge their “manhood,” such as public humiliation, failure, and appearing cowardly.<a id="_idTextAnchor728"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1698">50</a></span> In short, though the data is interpreted somewhat differently, some experimental evidence points to a difference between the way men and women experience and exhibit fear and anxiety.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<a id="_idIndexMarker844"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker845"></a><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e experimental data also points to a difference in the way men and women experience frustration.<a id="_idTextAnchor729"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1699">51</a></span> Males appear to respond more emotionally to frustrating situations. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eir behavior when frustrated is often aggressive, sometimes involving a violent attack on an object or a person, though they sometimes respond with a more generalized emotional upheaval. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e tests which have yielded this data have primarily studied child behavior; they have found that this difference in frustration reactions may begin as early as eighteen months.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
In conclusion, experimental studies have shown that men and women differ in levels of anxiety and frustration. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e obstacles to the experimental study of human emotions are considerable, and investigators are divided on the meaning and significance of the data. But the data does present a pattern of emotional differences between men and women.

<a id="_idIndexMarker846"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker847"></a>Intellectual Differences
</h3>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
Two major differences in intellectual abilities between men and women emerge from the experimental literature. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e first is <a id="_idIndexMarker848"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker849"></a>verbal ability, and the second is <a id="_idIndexMarker850"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker851"></a>spatial ability. Early studies tended to show that females had a consistent advantage in verbal ability from the age of first speech to adulthood.<a id="_idTextAnchor730"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1700">52</a></span> However, recent studies show males and females as generally equivalent in verbal abilities until the age of eleven or twelve, when females begin to surpass males in fluency, vocabulary, grammar, and spelling.<a id="_idTextAnchor731"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1701">53</a></span> Females carry this advantage through adolescence and into adulthood. On the other hand, males seem to have an advantage in visual-spatial ability, one which follows a pattern similar to verbal differences. Men and women seem to have no differences in visual-spatial ability until early adolescence, when males begin to demonstrate a superior ability to visualize objects in space and to accurately perceive the relationships between various objects.<a id="_idTextAnchor732"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1702">54</a></span> For example, men are generally more successful at perceiving a regular geometric form, such as a circle or a triangle, when it is camouflaged by random lines and curves. Corinne Hutt states that this gives men an advantage in such practical activities as aiming at a target, arranging objects according to a two-dimensional pattern, or having a good sense of direction.<a id="_idTextAnchor733"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1703">55</a></span> Julia Sherman also suggests that “superior spatial skill may partly account for their [men’s] known superior performance in aspects of geometry, mathematical problem solving, engineering, architecture, and the mathematical and physical sciences generally.”<a id="_idTextAnchor734"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1704">56</a></span>

<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e experimental literature is most consistent when discussing the physical differences between men and women.

<a id="_idIndexMarker866"></a><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e Causes of the Differences between Men and Women
</h3>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is review of the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical differences between men and women is helpful in itself. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese differences appear to be consistent characteristics of men and women in the modern world, and an understanding of them allows us to talk about men and women with less distortion. However, few researchers or popular writers stop at this point. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ey usually go on to raise questions about the causes of these differences between men and women. How influential are biological factors in the development of these differences? To what extent do early childrearing practices form the characteristic male and female personality of the growing child? Do other socialization processes have an impact on the development of men’s and women’s differences? <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese questions will now be examined.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Not all of the experiments which examine the differences between men and women also reveal the causes of these differences. Some experimental designs are simply not suited to produce such data. However, several experimental techniques do yield significant data about the causes of the differences between men and women.<a id="_idTextAnchor742"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1712">64</a></span> Six of these techniques, and some of the data which they have yielded, will now be examined.
</p>
<p class="HEADS---SUBHEADS_Subsubsubhead-Paragraph">
<span class="Semibold">Infant Behavior </span>▷ Many researchers study infant behavior to get beyond patterns of socialization because newly born infants are least influenced by a social environment.<a id="_idTextAnchor743"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1713">65</a></span> If male and female infants behave differently, the differences can be attributed almost exclusively to biological factors. However, this method has one important disadvantage: <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e infant’s range of behavior is very limited. In fact, that behavior in which researchers are most interested—aggression, nurturance, verbal ability, and so on—cannot be observed in infants. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e categories of behavior which psychological researchers normally investigate do not appear until a child begins to develop a distinctive personality. By this time, socialization and cultural conditioning are already well advanced. Nevertheless, a few behavioral differences between male and female infants have been found. Girls appear to have greater tactile sensitivity, and they display more types of oral behavior, such as reaching for the mouth with a hand, and reflex smiling. Boys probably have greater muscular strength than girls from birth, and they appear to startle more easily. More differences may be uncovered in the future as infant studies progress to a more advanced stage. However, at this point, no significant conclusion directly relevant to the concern of this book can be drawn from infant study data.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
However, studies of older children (ages three to seven years) have produced more significant results. Differences in aggression appear early, as do certain types of differences in activity rates. Girls may surpass boys in early verbal behavior, though the data is inconsistent on this point. Other social structural differences appear which will be discussed in the following chapter. However, one cannot safely attribute these differences among older children solely to biological factors. Children of ages three to seven years have already received much formation from their social environment. Nevertheless, data obtained from these studies can reveal something about the influence of biological factors, especially when the data is consistent and cross-culturally based, as in the studies of aggression.
</p>
<h3 class="HEADS---SUBHEADS_Subsubhead">
Cross-Cultural Studies
</h3>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
<a id="_idIndexMarker867"></a>Some investigators have looked to cross-cultural studies for help in distinguishing between biological and environmental influences. If one trait or temperamental pattern appears in several diverse cultures, then the characteristic may be highly influenced by biological factors. On the other hand, a high degree of diversity in such traits from culture to culture may indicate a high level of environmental influence.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-123-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-123">*</a></span></span> Cross-cultural studies have proven to be quite helpful in clarifying the causes of a few differences between men and women. In one study of aggression in seven cultures, young boys in all the cultures displayed more aggressive behavior than young girls.<a id="_idTextAnchor744"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1714">66</a></span> Boys engaged in more rough-and-tumble play, exchanged more verbal insults, and retaliated against aggression more readily than did girls. Another study of visual-spatial ability suggests that ability levels vary somewhat for men and women in different cultures depending on the level of autonomy a culture allows for children and women.<a id="_idTextAnchor745"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1715">67</a></span> However, this suggestion of some cross-cultural variation must be reconciled with other studies which show some genetic factors at work in visual-spatial ability. Probably both influences are at work. Finally, cross-cultural studies show that women exhibit certain kinds of nurturant behaviors at a higher level than men.<a id="_idTextAnchor746"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1716">68</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<a id="_idIndexMarker868"></a><span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is conclusion is supported by the cross-cultural anthropological work of Margaret Mead. In <span class="Italic">Male and Female</span>, first published in 1949, Mead draws some conclusions about men and women based on her field experience among seven Pacific cultures and on other anthropological and psychological research concerned with men’s and women’s differences. She concludes that men and women differ in several areas of temperament, including aggression and nurturance, and that these differences are rooted in biological realities. In particular, she strongly states her conviction that females are biologically predisposed to desire to bear and raise children, while males are predisposed to a restless ambition and a desire for achievement. She acknowledges that these predispositions can be redirected by a society, but she nevertheless sees them as extremely significant.<a id="_idTextAnchor747"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1717">69</a></span>
</p>
<p class="HEADS---SUBHEADS_Subsubsubhead-Paragraph">
<span class="Semibold">Animal Studies </span>▷ <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e study of animals, especially primates, has yielded important data which can be applied to efforts to understand the causes of differences between men and women. A key issue in understanding these origins is distinguishing between learned and biologically based behavior. It is obvious that much human behavior is learned. One of the features which most strongly differentiates homo sapiens from other animal species is the human capacity for learning and strong reliance on learned social behavior. Other animal species rely on learned behavior as well, but biological factors are more dominant. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>us, when one observes strong similarities between human and animal behavior (especially primate behavior) then there is some likelihood that a biological factor is at work in the human behavior.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-122-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-122">*</a></span></span> Scientists hotly debate the question of how directly we can compare animal behavior to analogous human behavior. However, most investigators, recognizing that humans are animals, agree that some valid comparisons can be made.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<a id="_idIndexMarker869"></a>Some animal studies which show higher levels of aggression in males and higher levels of nurturant behavior in females in all mammalian species have already been mentioned. In addition, animal studies have clarified some of the biological roots of aggression and nurturance. Adult exposure to male or female hormones influences the mature display of aggressive or nurturant behaviors, but these behaviors are also influenced significantly by the prenatal exposure of the brain to these hormones. Animal studies show that the animal brain is typed “male” or “female” just preceding or subsequent to birth. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese hormonal studies have been conducted and confirmed in many different species, including primates.<a id="_idTextAnchor749"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1718">70</a></span> Furthermore, animal studies have also clarified an important mechanism of learning which combines biology and socialization. In this type of learning, called “imprinting,” the members of a species are genetically programmed to learn certain behaviors at critical periods in their early development. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e concept of imprinting has already been effectively applied to the development of language skills and gender identity in humans.<a id="_idTextAnchor750"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1719">71</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Other differences between males and females have surfaced in animal experiments. Male and female monkeys react differently to stress situations in early life: Male infants respond to maternal separation with more abnormal behavior. Monkeys also react differently to novel external stimuli: Males approach, females withdraw.<a id="_idTextAnchor751"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1720">72</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese differences among animals do not necessarily indicate parallel differences among humans. However, when a similar pattern is found among humans (as it often is), the animal studies suggest that it is at least partially rooted in some biological factors.
</p>
<p class="HEADS---SUBHEADS_Subsubsubhead-Paragraph">
<span class="Semibold">Longitudinal Studies </span>▷ Longitudinal studies—that is, studies of a sample population over time—can often isolate causes of behavior more precisely than other types of experimental studies. A longitudinal study usually examines a small sample of individuals intensively over a period of years. Since the researcher works with the same group, he can often observe various behavior patterns more clearly and isolate specific causes more easily.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<a id="_idIndexMarker870"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker871"></a>Two longitudinal studies are especially significant for our purposes.<a id="_idTextAnchor752"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1721">73</a></span> Both have been conducted by John Money and his associates. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e first set of studies confirmed in humans the conclusion from animal studies that male hormones have a substantial effect on the fetal central nervous system. Money’s subjects were females suffering from the Adrenogenital Syndrome, a genetic defect which causes an excessive production of male hormones in a female fetus. Money’s study of these girls during their middle childhood produced some extremely significant data: An unusually large number of the girls were “tomboys,” expending a high level of physical energy on vigorous outdoor play, dressing in a “utilitarian and functional” manner, and preferring cars, trucks, and guns to dolls. In later life they subordinated marriage to career in thinking of the future, and entered romantic attachment with boys at a later age than a control group. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e results of this study strongly support the hypothesis that prenatal exposure of humans to hormones organizes the central nervous system along distinct “male” and “female” lines in a manner similar to that demonstrated in earlier animal experiments. It also appears that this prenatal sexual typing affects not only directly reproductive behavior but also behavior which is usually identified with the traditional male and female role.<a id="_idTextAnchor753"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1722">74</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
A second set of studies conducted by Money demonstrate the significance of environmental factors on how a child learns to identify himself as a male or a female. One of these studies was performed on a pair of identical twins, both genetically masculine. One of the twins was accidentally castrated at the time of circumcision, and was subsequently reared as a girl. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is child adapted successfully to the female role, and acted differently than the other twin who was raised as a male. At the same time, the twin with the female gender identity showed a high degree of “tomboyish” behavior tendencies, much like the young girls cited in the earlier study. Because of the unique and unfortunate circumstances surrounding this longitudinal study, it is not easily replicated and confirmed. However, Money has conducted other longitudinal studies which also suggest the importance of the sex of rearing in the formation of a person’s gender identity.<a id="_idTextAnchor754"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1723">75</a></span>
</p>
<p class="HEADS---SUBHEADS_Subsubsubhead-Paragraph">
<span class="Semibold"><a id="_idIndexMarker872"></a></span><span class="Semibold">Physiological Studies </span>▷ Some researchers have shown correlations between human physiological processes and emotional, behavioral, and intellectual differences between men and women. Money’s examination of the enduring effects of fetal exposure to male hormones is an example of this type of physiological/​behavioral study. Another helpful set of physiological studies have focused on the menstrual cycle.<a id="_idTextAnchor755"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1724">76</a></span> Studies conducted over the past thirty years confirm the popular belief that most women experience a cyclic emotional fluctuation corresponding to the various phases of the menstrual cycle. Endocrinologists hypothesize that this fluctuation results from the varying levels of estrogen and progesterone, the two primary female hormones, present in the female system at different phases of the female cycle. Low levels of estrogen and progesterone correlate with higher levels of anxiety, irritability, and depression; high levels of these hormones correlate with greater sense of well-being and self-esteem. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e degree of these emotional fluctuations vary from woman to woman according to the emotional stability of the individual woman and the environmental pressures she experiences. Other studies have examined the other stages in a woman’s life when estrogen and progesterone production decrease—immediately after childbirth and during menopause.<a id="_idTextAnchor756"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1725">77</a></span> Again, many women are more anxious, irritable, and depressed during these times. Physicians sometimes treat women suffering from severe menopausal depression with estrogen, and the treatment is usually successful. In short, studies of the hormonal variations within the female menstrual cycle reveal some important ways the female emotional makeup differs from the male makeup.

<span class="Semibold">Psychoanalytic <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>eory and Technique </span>▷ In some ways psychoanalysis is not an experimental technique like the others we have been discussing. Instead, it is more of an all-embracing theory of the origins of the differences between men and women. However, psychoanalysis should be examined because some research into the causes of sex differences has borrowed concepts from psychoanalytic theory. Erik Erikson has used the conceptual framework of psychoanalysis to study the different approaches to inner and outer space among male and female children.<a id="_idTextAnchor758"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1727">79</a></span> Judith Bardwick and other experimental psychologists have also made use of some psychoanalytic approaches.<a id="_idTextAnchor759"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1728">80</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e root of the psychoanalytic approach is the view that the differences between men and women develop mainly through a child’s evolving perception of anatomy and social roles. According to <a id="_idIndexMarker873"></a>Freud, the visibility of the male sexual organ produces in young girls “penis envy,” a sense of lack and a desire to have a penis. In the normal psycho-sexual developmental sequence, “penis envy” becomes a desire for children. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e male child suffers a different but corresponding trauma: He covets his penis, and fears that it will be forcibly taken from him by his father. Freud terms this fear “castration anxiety.” <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e boy conquers this fear by identifying with his father and the adult male role. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese concepts of “penis envy” and “castration anxiety” have been modified, reformulated, and supplemented by contemporary psychoanalysts. One common reformulation is known as the “womb envy” theory.<a id="_idTextAnchor760"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1729">81</a></span> <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is theory views male aggression and achievement orientation as a compensation for an inability to bear children. Psychoanalytic explanations for the differences between men and women differ substantially, but the basic psychoanalytic perspective remains the same: <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese differences develop in large part through a child’s perception of sexual anatomy and adult social roles.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-SA">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e psychoanalytic explanations of the origins of sex differences are quite controversial and much-disputed. However, if psychoanalytic explanations have any validity, they at least offer another perspective on the origins of men’s and women’s differences. In essence, psychoanalytic theory argues that some of the differences between men and women may not result merely from the direct influence of biological or sociological realities, but also from the individual’s psychological perception of biological and sociological realities.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-120-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-120">*</a></span></span> Psychoanalytic theory views both the family role and structure and the child’s sexual anatomy as crucial influences on sexual identity and role. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ough the biological factors are not necessarily direct determinants, they are seen as always exerting a powerful influence through the child’s anatomy. It is not clear how fruitful the psychoanalytic approach will be to the future research into the origins of men’s and women’s differences.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
To conclude, experimental methods of research have clearly uncovered many factors underlying the differences between men and women. Many of these factors are biological ones, as distinguished from factors which flow from processes of socialization or cultural conditioning. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e six methods surveyed here promise to yield important data in the future.<a id="_idTextAnchor763"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1730">82</a></span> As investigators refine these techniques and learn how to combine them (e.g., performing a cross-cultural study longitudinally), they should be able to cast more light on the origins of the differences between men and women.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is survey of the experimental data provides a helpful perspective on the results that will come from future research. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ose who wish to minimize the differences between men and women often state the results by saying that science (meaning usually experimental psychology) has <span class="Italic">only</span> established the existence of a limited number of biologically based differences. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is statement is true, although it is also true that the differences that have been established are of considerable importance for the human personality. However, the immature state of current research allows us to predict with considerable confidence that more differences will be established and more biological bases will be discovered in the future. Of course, the influence of socialization and cultural conditioning on the differences between men and women will also be highlighted. Nonetheless, we can expect that the direction of research will yield more experimentally confirmed differences between men and women and will establish more the biological origins for them.

Limitations of the Experimental Research
</h3>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
Like the descriptive literature discussed earlier, experimental psychology has advantages and limitations when applied to the study of the differences between men and women. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e chief strong points of the experimental studies are their sensitivity to causal factors and their use of measurements and test designs which yield clear quantitative data. However, the experimental research also contains some weaknesses and limitations. Some of these limitations are important to note.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
In general, experimental research into the differences between men and women is at an early stage of development.<a id="_idTextAnchor764"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1731">83</a></span> Experimental psychology as a whole is probably the least developed of the sciences, and within experimental psychology the study of men’s and women’s differences has received comparatively little attention. Indeed, much of the available data on men’s and women’s differences has been drawn from studies primarily concerned with other questions. Also, many experimental studies investigating possible differences between men and women have yielded both conflicting and inconclusive results. Such conflicts may mean that the hypothesized differences do not exist, or they may reflect serious conceptual and methodological problems blocking the discovery of significant data. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e experimental research must be assessed with these limitations in mind.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-SA">
Within this experimental research, the physiological studies currently provide the most reliable and useful data. Problems of measurement are reduced, as are problems involved in detecting underlying causes. Other experimental studies, especially those aimed at measuring social behavior and emotional states, suffer from weaknesses, most of which revolve around the problem of conceptualization. How does one define such elusive and subjective terms as passivity, dependence, emotionality, and empathy? In addition, the investigator must solve serious difficulties in operationalizing such terms—that is, he must define a qualitative category in quantitative terms. For example, an investigator who wants to study nurturance behavior in men must define “nurturance” in such a way that it refers to observable and measurable behavior. What is nurturant behavior in men? Obviously there is much male behavior which the investigator could define as nurturant. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e results of the experiment will depend on his choice of behavior and his choice of method of operationalizing his definition. Furthermore, emotional dispositions and underlying motivations are difficult to connect to standard behaviors. Eleanor Maccoby and Carol Jacklin make the point in this way:
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Block-Quote-Single">
Suppose it should prove true that children of one sex are more likely than those of the other to cry when the mother or father leaves them alone. Are these children more “attached” to the parent or more frightened of being alone? Or do they show more intense attachment behavior because they become frightened more easily? We have encountered frequent instances in which sex differences at an overt level of behavior are attributed to dispositions that are thought to underlie them.<a id="_idTextAnchor765"></a><span class="Endnote-Ref"><a href="36-Notes.html#_idTextAnchor1732">84</a></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
In other words, an experimental study may succeed at accurately measuring external behavior but then fail to connect it to the appropriate emotions and motives.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Another example of experimental problems of conceptualization arises in connection with “trait-patterns.” One of the most helpful insights contributed by the descriptive literature is the observation that the individual traits of men and women differ partly because of the differing pattern or organization of individual traits within men and women. Experimental methods are usually highly analytical, carefully separating one variable from another. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is method decreases the chances that broad overall patterns will be observed.<span class="Footnote-Ref"><span id="footnote-119-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-119">*</a></span></span>
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
To summarize, the experimental literature offers much data to illuminate the differences between men and women. However, the experimental findings must be approached with caution, for they are often sketchy and sometimes contradictory. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is caution should also make one more open to other sources of data, especially the descriptive literature.
</p>
<h2 class="HEADS---SUBHEADS_Less-Than-Subhead">
Final Comments
</h2>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body-NI">
<span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is review of the current states of descriptive and experimental studies of the individual differences between men and women leads to several broad conclusions. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e data shows that men and women differ emotionally, intellectually, and in their typical approaches to social relationships. Several of these differences are at least partially rooted in biological factors. Men and women also differ in the pattern or structure of their psychological makeup. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e social scientific data indicates clearly and decisively that men and women are not identical and interchangeable units.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
It is now possible to ask once again if the evidence from the social sciences about the individual differences between men and women fits with the scriptural role structure discussed in previous chapters. Before this question can be answered, another body of evidence from the social sciences must be examined. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>ese are studies of the patterns of men’s and women’s roles in various cultures, and the relationship between these social patterns and the individual psychological differences among men and women. After examining this literature, it will be more possible to assess how the social sciences can contribute to an understanding of a sound approach to men’s and women’s roles in the modern world. It will also be more possible to determine the relationship between the evidence from the social sciences and the teachings of the scripture.
</p>
<p class="BODY-STYLES_Body">
Finally, this review of the individual differences between men and women provides a perspective on the value of the common views of these differences mentioned earlier. Does this “conventional wisdom” receive support from the social sciences? Are women “warmer” and more emotional than men? Are men “tougher” than women, and less sexually self-controlled? And so forth. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e common-sense view seems generally based on truth, but none of the popular ways of describing men’s and women’s differences finds uncritical and unqualified endorsement from the social sciences. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>e common-sense view notes actual observed differences in the ways men and women behave, but its conceptual framework is too simplified. For example, women’s emotions function differently than men’s emotions, but it is not accurate to say that women are more emotional than men. Significant differences between men and women do exist. However, they must be carefully defined and described if they are to pass the test of scientific scrutiny.

Phenomenology is less well known in the United States and Britain than is psychoanalysis, but it is a significant intellectual movement on the European continent. Phenomenology is primarily a philosophical method, but it has direct application to psychology and the social sciences and has heavily influenced continental social science.

On the one hand, there is consistent, persuasive data showing that men are more aggressive than women, and that this higher level of aggression has a biological basis. On the other hand, there are also some observations which indicate that men more readily engage in various types of dominance behavior—struggling for position and prestige in a dominance hierarchy, trying to gain control over people and situations, and generally showing more readiness to compete. Is this learned behavior, or is it related to aggression—a difference between men and women which appears to have a biological basis?

<p class="FOOTNOTES_Footnote-Next">
It can be safely maintained that there is no reason to rule out the hypothesis that there is a biological component in the male domination of political, economic, and social activities that call for and reward competitive and aggressive behavior. <span class="No-Ligatures">Th</span>is behavior is almost certainly to some extent learned—the product of socialization and cultural conditioning.
